1,"The 139th was formed at Camp Howe , near Pittsburgh , on September 1 , 1862 . Frederick H. Collier was the first colonel . After burying the dead on the field of Second Battle of Bull Run , the regiment was attached to Howe 's Brigade of Couch 's Division of the IV Corps of the Army of the Potomac where it replaced De Trobriand 's 55th New York , Gardes Lafayette regiment on September 11 , 1862 . The composition of this brigade remained unchanged from this point until the war 's end and included the 62d NY , 93d PVI , 98th PVI and the 102d PVI . During this time Couch 's Division was detached from the Army and was occupied with guarding the fords on the Potomac . The 139th along with its brigade and division spent the next week marching from Poolesville to Sandy Hook , Maryland from where on September 17 , 1862 , it was forced marched to the Battle of Antietam where it was placed in line of battle but did not see any significant combat . The next day , the regiment pursued the Confederate army and fought in a skirmish at Williamsport . The 139th was transferred in October 1862 to the VI Corps . In the Battle of Fredericksburg , it suffered minor casualties from artillery fire , but did n't get a chance to fight . Five months later , however , it did participate in the 2nd Battle of Fredericksburg . At the Battle of Gettysburg in July , it helped defend the left flank of the Union army . Throughout the spring and into early summer of 1864 , the 139th fought in Grant 's Overland Campaign and the early stages of the Siege of Petersburg . In July , it was transferred to Washington , D.C. with the rest of the VI Corps to defeat Lt. Gen. Jubal Early 's attack on the city . Then they fought under Philip Sheridan in the Valley to ensure that no more Confederate armies would invade again . ( See the article on the campaign ) . By December 1864 , they were back in the siege lines of Petersburg . The 139th supported Sheridan in the Appomattox Campaign and fought in the Battle of Sayler 's Creek . After the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse , it was ordered to the North Carolina border to support William T. Sherman , but the Confederate surrender there made further support unnecessary . The regiment was mustered out June 21 , 1865 .",O I-ORG O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O I-LOC O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O I-LOC O O I-ORG O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-LOC O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O I-ORG O I-PER O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"The ORG was formed at LOC LOC , near LOC , on September 1 , 1862 .

2,"The 1896 Atlantic City rail crash occurred shortly after 6:30 pm on July 30 , 1896 at a crossing just west of Atlantic City , New Jersey , crushing five loaded passenger coaches , killing 50 and seriously injuring approximately 60 . A train consisting of seven cars left Atlantic City over the West Jersey Railroad bearing a special excursion of Red Men and their friends from Bridgeton and Salem , New Jersey , and had reached the crossing of the Reading Railroad when it was struck by the 5:40 down express train from Philadelphia . Two cars were demolished and the two following cars were telescoped . The engine of the Reading train was wrecked , the engineer killed , and the fireman fatally injured . The car behind it was thrown from the track and many of its occupants were killed or injured . In 1896 , leaving Atlantic City , the tracks of the West Jersey Road ran parallel to those of the Camden and Atlantic until they crossed the drawbridge , when they switched off to the south , crossing the Reading Road at an oblique angle . John Greiner , the engineer of the West Jersey train , saw the Reading train approaching the crossing at a swift speed , but as the signals were open for him to proceed on his way , he continued . His engine had barely cleared the crossing when the locomotive of the Reading train , which left Philadelphia at 5:40 pm , struck the first car full in the centre , throwing it far off the track in a nearby ditch , and completely submerging it . The second car of the West Jersey train was also carried into the ditch , the third and fourth cars being telescoped . The engine of the Reading train was thrown to the other side of the track , carrying with it the first coach . A few minutes after the collision , the boiler of the Reading locomotive exploded , scalding several to death and casting boiling spray over many of the injured passengers . As soon as the news reached Atlantic City it spread rapidly , and thousands of people flocked to the scene . The road leading to the collision was a constant scene of hackney carriages , omnibuses , bicycles , and all kinds of vehicles , while thousands of pedestrians hurried along the path to render what assistance they could or to satisfy their curiosity . Darkness fell quickly , and the work of rescuing the injured and recovering the bodies of the dead was carried out under the glare of huge bonfires . As onlookers watched through the night , the mangled and burned bodies of the dead were carried from the wreckage which trapped them and laid side by side on the gravel bank near the track , with no other covering than the few newspapers gathered from the passengers . The wounded were quickly gathered together and carried by train and wagon to the Atlantic City Hospital , where six of them died shortly after their arrival . Two others died within a day , with 42 having been killed at the collision scene . The old Excursion House at the foot of Mississippi Avenue was converted into a morgue , and the dead were taken there . During the first night after the crash , the streets in the vicinity of the Excursion House and the City Hospital , as well as the road leading to the scene of the accident , were packed with people anxious to learn the latest news . The Bridgeton and Salem excursionists who escaped injury were brought back to Atlantic City and sent home on a special train several hours later in the evening . James W. Hoyt , Secretary of the New Jersey Department of Public Safety , immediately upon learning of the extent of the accident , telegraphed for the Philadelphia Medical Emergency Corps , fifteen of whom responded , and hurried to Atlantic City on a special train which left Philadelphia at 10:45 pm . These surgeons materially aided Atlantic City 's volunteer corps , which was composed of almost every physician then living in the city . Many of the injured were taken to hotels , as the city hospitals soon became overcrowded . About thirty of the wounded had their injuries dressed and were able to proceed on their way . The wife of Edward Farr , the Reading engineer who died while on the job , and was found with one hand on the throttle and the other on the brake , when informed of the accident and of her husband 's death , was unable to withstand the shock , and fell to the floor dead . County Coroner William McLaughlin , immediately upon hearing of the accident , went to the scene . He went directly into the block tower and questioned operator George F. Hauser. Houser told him that he thought the excursion train had time to cross the tracks of the Reading before the express got there and he set the "" clear "" signal for the West Jersey train . ( The signalling system worked as follows : the interlocking block system was used . There were three poles with semaphores controlled by the tower on the reading tracks and two on the West Jersey . The pole furthest from the tower on the Reading tracks was distant about 2,000 yards . The other two were much closer . When the operator set the "" clear "" signal on the Pennsylvania track , this would automatically set the "" danger "" signal on the Reading track , and vice versa . ) Before Hauser could make a further explanation to the coroner he received an order from the railroad officials to say nothing . He obeyed , and made no further explanation . Pending an investigation , Hauser was put under arrest by the coroner , but was released on $500 bond . A jury was impanelled the following day . Testimony on August 4 appeared to implicate the dead Reading Railroad express engineer , Edward Farr . His action in running at a speed of forty-five miles an hour past a danger signal seemed inexplicable to those present at the inquest . His reputation was that of an experienced engineer and a man of exceptionally high moral character , and not of a reckless or careless disposition . Only two weeks previous to the accident his train was signalled to stop at that very crossing , and he promptly brought his train under control . The coroner 's jury returned verdicts on August 7 . Six jurors merely stated the manner of the passengers ' deaths . Three found that "" Engineer Edward D . Farr of the Atlantic City Railroad failed for have his engine under proper control on approaching [ the ] crossing , and that Tower Man George F. Hauser , in giving the excursion train of the West Jersey Railroad the right of way over a fast express used bad judgment. .. [ and ] that Engineer John Greiner of said excursion train erred in not exercising greater care on crossing ahead of said fast express .

Many people were killed or injured when the car behind it was thrown from the track.

The engineer of the LOC train saw the train approaching the crossing at a fast pace but the signals were open for him to go on his way. His engine had barely cleared the crossing when the locomotive of the LOC train struck the first car full in the center, throwing it far off the track in a nearby ditch. The second car of the LOC train was carried into the ditch. The engine of the LOC train was thrown to the other side of the track, carrying the first coach. The boiler of the LOC locomotive exploded a few minutes after the collision, killing several people and injuring many others. The news spread quickly and thousands of people showed up. The road leading to the collision was a constant scene of hackney carriages, omnibuses, bicycles, and all kinds of vehicles, while thousands of pedestrians hurried along the path to render what assistance they could or to satisfy their curiosity The work of saving the injured and recovering the bodies of the dead was done under the glare of huge bonfires.

Per, Secretary of the ORG, immediately upon learning of the extent of the accident, telegraphed for the ORG, fifteen of whom responded, and rushed to LOC on a special train which left LOC at 10:45 pm The surgeons aided the LOC's volunteer corps, which was composed of almost every physician in the city. Many of the injured were taken to hotels as the city hospitals became overcrowded. The wounded were able to proceed on their way after they had their injuries dressed. The wife of PER, the LOC engineer who died while on the job, and was found with one hand on the throttle and the other on the brake, when informed of the accident and of her husband's death, was unable to absorb the shock, and fell. The Coroner went to the scene after hearing about the accident. He went directly into the block tower and asked the operator if the excursion train had time to cross the tracks before the LOC train arrived. The interlocking block system was used for the signalling system. Three of the poles were controlled by the tower on the reading tracks while the other two were on the LOC. The pole furthest from the tower was not very close to the tracks. The other two were very close to each other. The danger signal on the LOC track would be set by the operator if they set the clear signal on the LOC track. The railroad officials ordered PER to say nothing before he could make a further explanation to the coroner. He didn't make any further explanation. PER was released on a $500 bond after he was put under arrest. A jury was put together the next day. Testimony on August 4 appeared to implicate the dead LOC express engineer. His action in running at a speed of forty-five miles an hour past a danger signal was inexplicable to those present at the inquest. His reputation was that of an experienced engineer and a man of high moral character, and not of reckless or careless disposition. He brought his train under control two weeks before the accident after he was told to stop at that very crossing. On August 7, the jury returned verdicts. The manner of the passengers' deaths was stated by six jurors. Engineer PER was found by three people. The excursion train of the LOC was given the right of way over a fast express by Tower Man PER, who used bad judgement. Engineer PER of the excursion train was wrong in not exercising greater care on crossing ahead of the fast express. The cause of the collision was the failure of PER, the engineer of the train, to give heed in time to the semaphore signals and crossing rules. The tower man may have used poor judgement in his estimate of the distance away from the LOC train when he gave the white boards. 700 is the number.","The 1896 LOC rail crash occurred shortly after 6:30 pm on July 30 at a crossing just west of LOC, crushing five loaded passenger coaches and killing 50 and seriously injuring 60. A train consisting of seven cars left LOC over the LOC with a special excursion for MISC and their friends from LOC and LOC, LOC, and had reached the crossing of the LOC when it was struck by the express train from LOC. Two cars were demolished and two more were telescoped. The fireman was killed and the engineer was killed when the engine of the LOC train wrecked. Many of the people in the car that was thrown from the track were dead or injured. The tracks of the LOC ran parallel to those of the LOC and LOC until they crossed the drawbridge when they switched off to the south. The engineer of the LOC train saw the train approaching the crossing at a rapid speed but the signals were open for him to go on his way. His engine had barely cleared the crossing when the locomotive of the LOC train struck the first car full in the centre, throwing it off the track in a nearby ditch. The second car of the LOC train was carried into the ditch, along with the third and fourth cars. The LOC train's engine was thrown to the other side of the track, carrying the first coach. A few minutes after the collision, the boiler of the LOC locomotive exploded, killing several passengers and injuring many others. Thousands of people came to the scene as soon as the news spread. The road leading to the collision was a constant scene of hackney carriages, omnibuses, bicycles, and all kinds of vehicles, while thousands of pedestrians hurried along the path to offer assistance or to satisfy their curiosity. The work of recovering the bodies of the dead was carried out under the glare of huge bonfires as darkness fell. As onlookers watched through the night, the mangled and burned bodies of the dead were carried from the wreck and laid side by side on the gravel bank near the track, with no other covering other than the few newspapers gathered from the passengers. The wounded were quickly gathered together and carried by train and wagon to the org, where six of them died. 42 people died at the collision scene and two others died within a day. The old LOC at the foot of it was converted into a mortuary. The streets in the vicinity of the LOC and the ORG were packed with people anxious to learn the latest news after the crash. The LOC and LOC excursionists who escaped injury were sent home on a special train. Per, Secretary of the ORG, immediately upon learning of the extent of the accident, telegraphed for the ORG, fifteen of whom responded and hurried to LOC on a special train which left LOC at 10:45 pm The surgeons aided the LOC's volunteer corps, which was composed of almost every doctor in the city. Many of the injured were taken to hotels as the city hospitals soon became overcrowded. Thirty of the wounded had their injuries dressed and were able to go on their way. The wife of PER, the LOC engineer who died while on the job, and was found with one hand on the throttle and the other on the brake, when informed of the accident and of her husband's death, was unable to resist the shock, and fell. The Coroner went to the scene immediately after hearing of the accident. He went directly into the block tower and asked the operator if the excursion train had time to cross the LOC before the express got there. The interlocking block system was used. There were three poles with semaphores on the reading tracks and two on the LOC. The furthest pole from the tower on the LOC tracks was not very far away. The other two were very close. The danger signal on the LOC track would be set by the operator when they set the clear signal on the LOC track. Railroad officials ordered PER to say nothing before he could make a further explanation to the coroner. He did not make a further explanation. PER was released on a $500 bond after being put under arrest for an investigation. On the following day, a jury was seated. The testimony on August 4 appeared to implicate the dead LOC express engineer. His action in running at a speed of forty five miles an hour past a danger signal seemed inexplicable to those present at the inquest. His reputation was that of an experienced engineer and a man of high moral character, not a reckless or careless disposition. He brought his train under control two weeks prior to the accident after he was told to stop at that very crossing. The jury returned their verdicts on August 7. Six jurors stated the manner of the passengers' deaths. "" Engineer PER"" was found by three.

4,"30 Seconds to Mars ( or Thirty Seconds to Mars ) is an alternative rock band from Los Angeles , California , featuring Jared Leto , Shannon Leto , Tomo Milicevic . Created in 1998 by Jared Leto and his brother , Shannon , 30 Seconds to Mars began as a small family project . Things began to speed up quickly , and Matt Wachter later joined the band as bassist and keyboard player . After working with small revolving door of guitarists ( as the band 's first two guitarists , Kevin Drake and Solon Bixler , left the band due to issues primarily related to touring ) , the three auditioned Tomo Miličević to round out the band 's roster . According to an interview from Virgin Records , the band 's name 30 Seconds to Mars ' first , self-titled album , produced by Bob Ezrin , was released in 2002 to mixed reviews and achieved sales of just over 100,000 . Their sophomore album , A Beautiful Lie , was released on August 30 , 2005 . For this effort , the band traveled ( during the course of three years ) to four continents , to perfect their sound and also to allow for Jared 's film career . The album was produced by Josh Abraham , whose producing credits also include Orgy , Velvet Revolver , and Linkin Park . Because A Beautiful Lie was leaked five months before its release , the band decided to include two bonus tracks : "" Battle of One "" ( an original song that was also set to be the album 's title track when it was first announced ) and "" Hunter "" ( a cover of the Björkband song ) . To further promote the album , the band also enclosed "" golden tickets "" in 12 copies , which granted their owners access to any 30 Seconds to Mars concert free of charge , along with backstage access . On August 31 , 2006 , the band won the MTV2 Award for "" The Kill "" at the MTV Video Music Awards , one of their two nominations . The second nomination was for Best Rock Video ; however , they lost to AFI 's "" Miss Murder "" . In the video members of the band reenact scenes from The Shining . A Beautiful Lie was certified platinum by the RIAA in January for distribution of over 1,000,000 albums . In October , the band began their "" Welcome to the Universe "" tour , sponsored by MTV2 . They were supported on this tour by Head Automatica , The Receiving End of Sirens , Cobra Starship , and several other bands including Street Drum Corps . The tour was "" environmentally sound "" according to a 2006 interview with then-bassist Matt Wachter . "" Jared and Shannon put together this thing called Environmentor which is illustrating ways --- alternatives --- to kind of clean up some of the mess we leave behind . We fueled the bus with vegetable oil , "" he explains . On November 20 , MTV2 premiered the video for "" From Yesterday "" ; the video is the first American rock video ever shot in its entirety in the People 's Republic of China . The music video is loosely based on the film The Last Emperor . On April 29 , 2007 , the band performed at the Australian MTV Australia Video Music Awards , where they were nominated for three awards , winning "" Best Rock Video "" and "" Video of the Year "" for "" The Kill "" . As of Spring 2007 , the band is supporting The Used as a part of the "" Taste of Chaos "" tour and have scheduled a string of dates in Europe supporting Linkin Park . They are also scheduled to play Roskilde , Rock am Ring , Pinkpop , Give It A Name Festival and Download . Following other commitments , they will begin working on their third album . Following the release of "" From Yesterday "" as a single , the band posted a link on their MySpace blog to vote for the next single from A Beautiful Lie . The choices available were "" A Beautiful Lie "" , "" The Fantasy "" , "" Savior "" , and "" The Story "" . Another vote was done later between the top two songs , "" A Beautiful Lie "" and "" The Fantasy "" . On May 2 , 2007 , the band announced that "" A Beautiful Lie "" had won and would be the next single . On August 8th , 2007 , Kerrang ! announced that 30 Seconds to Mars has been nominated for two categories of the Kerrang ! Awards 2007 - Best International Newcomer and Best Single - The Kill . On August 24th , they had only won the award for ' Best Single , ' which was The Kill . The other award was lost to Madina Lake . On November 1 , 2007 , the band won the MTV Europe Music Award for "" Rock Out "" , one of the two catorgories they were nominated in . On December 21st , 2007 , 30 Seconds to Mars won Fuse 's Best of 2007 Award . They beat out Korn and had amassed over 7 million votes . 31 other bands and artists such as Justin Timberlake , Gwen Stefani , Linkin Park and Avenged Sevenfold were also included in the contest . The band 's phoenix logo ( which the band named "" Mithra "" ) bears the phrase "" Provehito in Altum "" , the band 's motto . Roughly translated from Latin , this means "" Launch forth into the deep "" ; but a more stylized version would be "" Rocket in ( to ) High ( ness ) "" . The logo was primarily used for promotion of the band 's debut , whereas for A Beautiful Lie , the new Trinity logo was created consisting of three skulls , along with the band 's name and motto . The Echelon is a publicity street team for the band 30 Seconds to Mars , which helps in bringing friends to the shows , phoning local radio stations to request the band 's songs , putting up posters , posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online , and maintaining magazines or websites dedicated to the band . It is also the name of one of their songs in the album 30 Seconds to Mars . The band made acoustic versions of songs from their second album A Beautiful Lie . Some of the acoustics have been included in some versions of the album , e.g. Was it a Dream ? ( Acoustic ) . In addition to the tracks on their two full-length releases thus far , the band has also recorded a few other tracks . Among these tracks are "" Phase 1 : Fortification "" and "" Valhalla "" , the latter of which was present on an early demo . "" Phase 1 : Fortification "" was released on an overseas single for "" Capricorn ( A Brand New Name ) "" . Another track featured on certain imported 30 Seconds to Mars titles is "" Anarchy in Tokyo "" , a song that was recorded during the process of their self-titled debut . "" Revolution "" was also recorded for the self-titled album , but was n't included because it did n't fit the theme of the album , and because of fear that listeners would take the lyrics too literally , especially after the September 11 , 2001 attacks . "" Occam 's Razor "" was also recorded , but was never included on any of the band 's releases . As a result , it is considered the most difficult to locate of the five unreleased tracks . Demo versions of songs on the band 's self-titled debut were also slightly different , along with different names . For example , "" Fallen "" was previously called "" Jupiter "" , and "" Year Zero "" was previously called "" Hero "" . Also made available are the demo versions of "" Buddha for Mary "" and "" 93 Million Miles "" ; the latter originally had lyrics referring to the band Deadsy , whose members Dr. Nner and P. Exeter Blue I provided extra instrumentation on several tracks , but the lyrics were changed after the two bands were involved in a small feud . During recent live shows , the band has premiered two new songs , one of which may end up on the new album : "" Some Other Son "" and "" The Believer "" , which were initially written for the self-titled album but was scrapped during recording , as well as live songs such as "" Sisters of Heresy "" and "" Under Pressure / Pressure "" ( Name of song unsure , name based on lyrics ) . They also have a song called "" Time to Wake Up . "" On December 11 , 2006 , the band sent their fans a "" stocking stuffer "" in the form of a holiday song called "" Santa Through the Back Door "" . In September 2007 , the band also recorded a cover of Kanye West 's "" Stronger "" for BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge .",I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O I-PER O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-PER O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O I-MISC O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O I-MISC O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-MISC O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-MISC I-MISC O,"ORG ORG ORG ORG ( or ORG ORG ORG ORG ) is an alternative rock band from LOC LOC , LOC , featuring PER PER , PER PER , PER PER .

7,"6PR , known as 882 6PR , commenced broadcasting on October 14 , 1931 . 6PR 's focus is on news , talk and sport , and is Perth 's only commercial talkback radio station . 6PR is owned by Fairfax Media , an Australian media company that owns television and radio businesses throughout Australia . Radio in Australia was just twelve years old when 6PR commenced broadcasting on October 14 , 1931 . 6PR was founded by electrical company Nicholson 's Limited , which ran the station from a studio above its showroom in Barrack Street , Perth . In 1963 the Victorian Broadcasting Network purchased Nicholson 's and sold the electrical division of the organisation to Vox Adeon . The broadcasting business was retained and operated under the name Nicholson 's Broadcasting Service Pty Ltd . The operation moved from Barrack Street to 340 Hay Street just after the purchase by the VBN in 1963 . The 6PR studio remained at 340 Hay Street for 22 years before it was demolished to make way for the expansion of Mercedes College . In 1985 the station relocated to its current premises at 169 Hay Street , East Perth . In the station 's early days there were only four people on the payroll now there are around one hundred . The limited hours of broadcasting 69 years ago have gradually been increased to a 24 hour , seven day a week service . Throughout the sixties 6PR was consistently the top rating station in Perth but lost its dominance in 1972 . The image of the station changed from rock n roll to beautiful music with the "" Gentle On Your Mind "" promotion in 1973 . This boosted 6PR 's ratings to a consistent number two with a number one position on several occasions . In 1977 an agreement was made with the TAB by the station 's owners to broadcast races in conjunction with a personality / sport format . In the early eighties the station commenced a more comprehensive news and current affairs format with the introduction of regular programs by Howard Sattler , Bob Maumill and Graham Mabury , which proved extremely popular with listeners . In 1987 the TAB purchased 6PR to secure the future of race broadcasts in Western Australia and races were broadcast across the station during popular talkback programs . During the early nineties the station 's current affairs / talkback program hosted by Sattler , Maumill , Mabury , Peter Newman , Gary Carvolth and Rob Broadfield achieved considerable success in spite of the ever increasing level of racing broadcasts on the station . In 1994 6PR , in conjunction with the TAB , was able to secure a special narrowcast broadcast license which allowed racing broadcasts to be moved from 6PR to the narrowcast broadcaster called Racing Radio . This move allowed 6PR to serve its two distinct audiences , those who listened purely for a talkback / news / current affairs format and those who listened just for racing information , in a more comprehensive manner . In December 1994 6PR was purchased by its current owner Southern Cross Broadcasting which also owned Melbourne 's number one rating talk station 3AW and television stations in Adelaide , Canberra and other places . During the nineties 6PR continued its dominance in the talk format arena with personalities such as David Christison & Lee Tate , Howard Sattler , Jenny Seaton & Gary Carvolth , Liam Bartlett , Harvey Deegan and Graham Mabury . During the Australian Rules Football Season 882 6PR is Perth 's Football Leader . Each week , Brad Hardie , George Grljusich , Karl Langdon , Graham Dawson , Basil Zempilas Glen Jakovich & Shane Woewodin keep you up-to-date with all things football . The AFL commentary team is composed of Basil Zempilas , Karl Langdon , Glen Jakovich , Shane Woewodin , Graham Dawson , Shane Healy and Brad Hardie . With commentary teams in both Melbourne and Perth , 6PR is able to cover every home and away match for the West Coast Eagles and Fremantle Dockers , while also being able to broadcast matches involving other teams utilising their traveling team based in Melbourne . Matches that are unable to be covered by either commentary team are broadcast on-relay from sister stations 3AW in Melbourne and FIVEaa in Adelaide . The local West Australian Football League is also broadcast via a program on 6PR called Bouncing Around . Peter Vlahos is based in the 6PR Studio while Karl Langdon & Harvey Deegan base themselves at different matches . Peter Vlahos then crosses between the two men as they broadcast parts of their matches & respond to football related talkback calls . Updates of all four WAFL matches are provided & AFL Results are also mentioned . Since the addition of the Perth Glory into the Australian national football ( soccer ) competition ( known then as the National Soccer League ) 6PR has broadcast almost all Home & Away matches , The coverage was led by George Grljusich . When the A-League began in 2005 only home matches were broadcast on 6PR . 6PR stopped broadcasting Perth Glory matches after the 2005/2006 A-League season . As of the 2007/2008 A-League season 6PR will again broadcast every Perth Glory Home & Away fixture . 6PR will be the official Radio Broadcast partner of the Perth Glory From 2006 , 882 6PR will broadcast every Western Force home game live from Subiaco Oval .

14,"Agotes or Cagots were a discriminated minority in the Navarrese Pyrenees , Basque provinces , Bearn , Gascony and also Brittany . They have been also known by other names : Cagots , Gahets , Gafets in France ; Agotes , Gafos in Spain ; and Cacons , Cahets , Caqueux and Caquins in Brittany . The earliest mention of them is in 1288 , when they appear to have been called Christiens or Christianos . During the Middle Ages they were popularly looked upon as cretins , lepers , heretics and even as cannibals . They were shunned and hated ; were allotted separate quarters in towns , called cagoteries , and lived in wretched huts in the country distinct from the villages . Excluded from all political and social rights , they were only allowed to enter a church by a special door , and during the service a rail separated them from the other worshippers . Either they were altogether forbidden to partake of the sacrament , or the Eucharist was handed to them on the end of a stick , while a receptacle for holy water was reserved for their exclusive use . They were compelled to wear a distinctive dress , to which , in some places , was attached the foot of a goose or duck ( whence they were sometimes called Canards ) . And so pestilential was their touch considered that it was a crime for them to walk the common road barefooted . The only trades allowed them were those of butcher and carpenter , and their ordinary occupation was wood-cutting . The origin of Agotes ( or Cagots ) is uncertain . It has been suggested that they were descendants of the Visigoths , and somebody derives the name from caas ( dog ) and Goth . But opposed to this etymology is the fact that the word "" cagot "" is first found in this form no earlier than 1551 . French historian Pierre de Marca ( 16th century ) , in his Histoire de Beam , holds that the word signifies hunters of the Goths , and that the Cagots are descendants of the Saracens . Others made them descendants of the Albigenses . A far more probable explanation of their name Christians is to be found in the fact that in medieval times all lepers were known as pauperes Christi , and that , Goths or not , these Cagots were affected in the Middle Ages with a particular form of leprosy or a condition resembling it . Thus would arise the confusion between Christians and Cretins . It was not until the French Revolution that any steps were taken to ameliorate their lot , but today they no longer form a class and have been practically lost sight of in the general peasantry .",I-MISC O I-MISC O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O I-LOC O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-LOC O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-LOC O O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O I-MISC O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-MISC O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"MISC or MISC were a discriminated minority in the LOC LOC , LOC LOC , LOC , LOC and also LOC .

20,"The Amateur Hockey Association of Canada ( AHAC ) was an amateur men 's ice hockey league founded in 1886 , in existence until 1898 . It was the second ice hockey league organized in Canada , after one in Kingston , Ontario started in 1883 . It was organized to provide a longer season to determine the Canadian champion . Prior to its founding the Canadian championship was determined in a tournament in Montreal . The 1893 champion of the league , Montreal Hockey Club was the first winner of the Stanley Cup , being awarded the Cup as the champions of the AHAC and the AHAC was considered the top league of Canada . of various hockey clubs met at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal at the instigation of the Victoria Hockey Club of Montreal . They agreed that the season should run from the 1st of January until the 15th of March . The constitution would be adapted from a lacrosse league constitution . The teams knew each other . Mr . Thomas D . Green of Ottawa had played on the 1883 McGill hockey team . In that age , ice hockey was a very different game compared to today : the AHAC rules stated that there were six skaters on each side . The left wing , centre and right wing were the forwards , like today . The rover would line up behind the centre , with the point and coverpoint following , in an ' I ' formation towards the goaltender . The face offs were at a right angle to today 's practice , the centre men facing inwards from the sides of the rink . The goaltenders used no special equipment . There were no goal nets . The goals were two posts , with no crossbar . An umpire would judge the legality of each score . There were no boards along the sides of the ice , and there were no standard dimensions for a rink , although dimensions were instituted for the positioning of the goal out from the ends of the rink . A match was two halves of thirty minutes ( also to note that in the day , game meant goal by modern definition ) . Sudden-death overtime was also in place , and a match would continue until a goal was scored in the event of a tie after regulation . Players in all positions would normally play the entire 60 minutes . The AHAC operated on two different systems in its lifetime : the challenge system , where a championship team would face a new challenger each week for the championship , and the series system , which corresponds to the regular season found in the NHL today . With the exception of 1888 , the challenge system was exclusively used in the AHAC before the advent of the Stanley Cup , while the series system became the norm in 1893 , the first year the Cup was contested . The first championship team of the AHAC was the Montreal Crystals , having unofficially being declared the champions before the AHAC . The first title change occurred on January 14 , 1887 , when the Montreal Victorias defeated the champions 4-0 . The Victorias would hold the title until the very last challenge game , when the Crystals won 3-2 in their third successive challenge . Because of the Vics ' long run as champions , it was decided to switch to the series system in 1888 . The series system was a success , although a tie atop the standings between the Vics and the Montreal Hockey Club ( Montreal HC ) , and the subsequent scheduling of the tiebreaker game caused much trouble when the game was scheduled at a time when two Victorias players were injured , at the home venue of the Montreal HC . However , teams from outside Montreal incurred huge travelling expenses , which led the AHAC to revert back to the challenge system . In 1893 , the first year since 1888 where the AHAC played under a series system , the Montreal Hockey Club lost their first game against the Ottawa Hockey Club , and proceeded to win their next seven en route to the championship . Lord Stanley announced that his challenge trophy ( later known simply as the Stanley Cup ) for the best amateur hockey team in Canada would be presented to the Montreal Hockey Club on May 15 , 1893 , as initial champion . At the time , the Montreal Hockey Club was in a dispute with its parent organization , the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association ( MAAA ) . The hockey club was adamant about refusing the trophy , while the directors of the MAAA decided to accept the trophy , considering it came from the Governor General of Canada . Thus , the trophy was accepted by the MAAA , but with none of the hockey officials of the hockey club present . After accepting the trophy , the hockey club remained adamant about returning the trophy that was presented to them . In the end , the MAAA investigated into why its hockey club wanted to refuse and return the trophy , even though such an action would damage the reputation of the MAAA . It was believed that the people who were in charge of running their team were , in fact , not representative of the team itself , and when the hockey club asked for a loan of $175 in start-up expenses for the 1894 season , it was flatly refused ( the first time the MAAA refused anything to the hockey club ) . Inexplicably , the hockey club reversed its position , and the next few months saw a gradual schism between the MAAA and the club . Indeed , the inscriptions on the Cup when it was successfully defended in 1894 only stated "" Montreal HC "" . The MAAA , at one point , considered the hockey club to have seceded from the organization that bore them . The issue would be finally resolved in later years , after various attempts at reconciliation . † Stanley Cup winner According to Arthur Farrell 's book of 1899 , "" Hockey : Canada 's Royal Winter Game "" , Montreal Crystals are recorded as champions in 1887 , and the Montreal Hockey Club is recorded as the winner from 1888-1894 . See reference copy on Backcheck . According to Ultimate Hockey , the play between 1887 and 1892 occurred in the challenge format and the title of champion could change after every series . The final champion at the end of the season 's worth of challenges would be considered ' Dominion of Canada ' champion .",O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O I-MISC O O O O O I-ORG O O I-ORG O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER O I-LOC O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O,"The ORG ORG ORG ORG ORG ( ORG ) was an amateur men 's ice hockey league founded in 1886 , in existence until 1898 .

They agreed that the season should run from the 1st of January until the 15th of March . The constitution would be adapted from a lacrosse league constitution . The teams knew each other . Mr . PER1 . PER2 of LOC9 had played on the 1883 ORG7 hockey team . In that age , ice hockey was a very different game compared to today : the ORG8 rules stated that there were six skaters on each side . The left wing , centre and right wing were the forwards , like today . The rover would line up behind the centre , with the point and coverpoint following , in an ' I ' formation towards the goaltender . The face offs were at a right angle to today 's practice , the centre men facing inwards from the sides of the rink . The goaltenders used no special equipment . There were no goal nets . The goals were two posts , with no crossbar . An umpire would judge the legality of each score . There were no boards along the sides of the ice , and there were no standard dimensions for a rink , although dimensions were instituted for the positioning of the goal out from the ends of the rink . A match was two halves of thirty minutes ( also to note that in the day , game meant goal by modern definition ) . Sudden-death overtime was also in place , and a match would continue until a goal was scored in the event of a tie after regulation . Players in all positions would normally play the entire 60 minutes . The ORG9 operated on two different systems in its lifetime : the challenge system , where a championship team would face a new challenger each week for the championship , and the series system , which corresponds to the regular season found in the ORG10 today . With the exception of 1888 , the challenge system was exclusively used in the ORG11 before the advent of the MISC5 , while the series system became the norm in 1893 , the first year the MISC6 was contested . The first championship team of the ORG12 was the ORG13 , having unofficially being declared the champions before the ORG14 . The first title change occurred on January 14 , 1887 , when the ORG15 defeated the champions 4-0 . The ORG16 would hold the title until the very last challenge game , when the ORG17 won 3-2 in their third successive challenge . Because of the ORG18 ' long run as champions , it was decided to switch to the series system in 1888 . The series system was a success , although a tie atop the standings between the ORG19 and the ORG110 ( ORG111 ) , and the subsequent scheduling of the tiebreaker game caused much trouble when the game was scheduled at a time when two ORG112 players were injured , at the home venue of the ORG113 . However , teams from outside LOC10 incurred huge travelling expenses , which led the ORG114 to revert back to the challenge system . In 1893 , the first year since 1888 where the ORG115 played under a series system , the ORG116 lost their first game against the ORG117 , and proceeded to win their next seven en route to the championship . PER3 announced that his challenge trophy ( later known simply as the MISC7 ) for the best amateur hockey team in LOC11 would be presented to the ORG118 on May 15 , 1893 , as initial champion . At the time , the ORG119 was in a dispute with its parent organization , the ORG1110 ( ORG1111 ) . The hockey club was adamant about refusing the trophy , while the directors of the ORG1112 decided to accept the trophy , considering it came from the Governor General of LOC12 . Thus , the trophy was accepted by the ORG1113 , but with none of the hockey officials of the hockey club present . After accepting the trophy , the hockey club remained adamant about returning the trophy that was presented to them . In the end , the ORG1114 investigated into why its hockey club wanted to refuse and return the trophy , even though such an action would damage the reputation of the ORG1115 . It was believed that the people who were in charge of running their team were , in fact , not representative of the team itself , and when the hockey club asked for a loan of $175 in start-up expenses for the 1894 season , it was flatly refused ( the first time the ORG1116 refused anything to the hockey club ) . Inexplicably , the hockey club reversed its position , and the next few months saw a gradual schism between the ORG1117 and the club . Indeed , the inscriptions on the MISC8 when it was successfully defended in 1894 only stated "" ORG1118 "" . The ORG1119 , at one point , considered the hockey club to have seceded from the organization that bore them . The issue would be finally resolved in later years , after various attempts at reconciliation . † MISC9 winner According to PER4 's book of 1899 , "" MISC10 "" , ORG11110 are recorded as champions in 1887 , and the ORG11111 is recorded as the winner from 1888-1894 . See reference copy on Backcheck . According to MISC11 , the play between 1887 and 1892 occurred in the challenge format and the title of champion could change after every series .

22,"Angela Carder ( née Stone ) was an American cancer patient who , in 1987 , was forced to undergo a life-threatening Caesarean section in an unsuccessful attempt to save the life of her fetus . The case stands as a landmark in United States case law establishing the rights of pregnant women to determine their own health care . At age thirteen , Angela Stoner was diagnosed with a rare and usually fatal form of cancer . She survived , and after years of chemotherapy and radiation therapy was declared to be in remission . Ten years after the initial diagnosis she developed another form of cancer , which she and her doctors fought with equal determination . The second cancer went into remission . Angela later married and became pregnant . In 1987 , when Carder was twenty-five weeks pregnant , her cancer was discovered to have recurred and metastasized to her lung . Exactly what plan she made on learning this is unclear : one source claims that she was determined to prolong her life , and elected to start radiation and chemotherapy , regardless of known risks to the fetus ; others state that she chose to institute only palliative care , in an effort to remain alive until the 28th week of gestation , when it was thought the fetus would have a better chance of survival . Whatever her choice , the administrators of George Washington University Hospital -- who were also the liability risk managers -- were disturbed to hear that she had not elected to have an immediate C-section procedure . Fearing a lawsuit by pro-life activists , they convened a court hearing at the hospital and obtained separate counsels for Carder , her fetus , and the hospital .

A neonatologist who was not familiar with the woman's medical status testified that the fetus had at least a 60% chance of survival. The long-term oncologist for PER was not contacted and he would have called the procedure medically inadvisable for PER and for the fetus. An order was issued for the hospital to perform an immediate C-section despite medical testimony that such a procedure would probably end PER's life. Obstetricians at the hospital initially refused to carry out the procedure, but eventually one agreed. A three-judge appellate panel upheld the decision in an emergency telephone appeal despite PER's repeated pleas. Exactly how long the fetus lived is a matter of disagreement. Two hours is the most commonly cited figure. The doctor who performed the surgery said that trying to inflate the fetus's lungs was like trying to breathe in a rock. Per had her surgery two days later. In the wake of the surgery, PER's family and the ORG's ORG asked the ORG to take back the order and its legal precedent because it had violated PER's right to informed consent and her constitutional rights of privacy and bodily integrity. A hundred twenty organizations filed briefs on PER's behalf. One attorney for the hospital argued that it was appropriate to sacrifice a dying woman for her fetus, and an appeals court judge replied, ""Are you urging this court to find that you can handcuff a woman to a bed and force her to give birth? The ORG and PER's parents instituted a civil action against the hospital for deprivation of human rights, discrimination and wrongful death.

25,"A Portuguesa is the national anthem of Portugal . It was written by Henrique Lopes de Mendonça ( lyrics ) and Alfredo Keil ( music ) after the nationalist resurgence provoked by the British Ultimatum ( for Portuguese troops to vacate the territory between Angola and Mozambique ) , was adopted as a Republican anthem and , finally , by the new Portuguese Republic in 1910 as the national anthem , replacing "" O Hymno da Carta "" , the last anthem of the Constitutional Monarchy in Portugal . The title A Portuguesa means "" the Portuguese ( song ) "" --- the Portuguese word for "" song "" , canção , being feminine --- just as La Marseillaise , the national anthem of France , is "" the song of Marseille "" , the Belgian anthem , The Brabançonne is "" the song of Brabant "" , and L'Internationale , the Socialist anthem , is "" the international ( song ) "" . In 1890 , the United Kingdom issued an ultimatum demanding Portugal give up its intentions of occupying the land between the African colonies of Angola , on the western coast , and Mozambique , on the eastern coast , thus joining the two territories . Despite popular uproar , the government was forced to accept the British terms , a measure that contributed to the growing unpopularity of King Carlos I and the monarchy and gained supporters for the already boosting republican movement . Inspired by the common feeling of outrage among the people , writer Henrique Lopes de Mendonça composed a poem urging his compatriots to "" fight for the fatherland "" ( Pela Pátri luta ) and praising the country 's past as a naval power , particularly in the 15th and 16th centuries . The words were set to a melody by composer Alfredo Keil and the song soon became popular among people unhappy with what they considered a submissive and humiliating attitude by the Portuguese authorities . On January 31 , 1891 , a republican revolution broke out in the northern city of Porto and "" A Portuguesa "" was adopted by the rebels as their anthem . The revolution was crushed and the song banned . In 1910 , on October 5 , a new revolution succeeded in overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic in Portugal .

30,"The Australian League of Rights is a minor political organisation in Australia founded by Eric Butler with its basis in the economic theory of Social Credit expounded by C. H. Douglas . It describes itself as upholding the virtues of freedom . It is not a political party , but rather sees itself as a watchdog against government intervention . The League was formed in 1960 by a merger of various Leagues of Rights based in the Australian states , the first of which was based in South Australia from 1946 . The League 's founder Eric Butler died on June 9 2006 , at the age of 90 . The League , like many other far-Right organisations , strongly denies that the Holocaust , during which millions of people , particularly European Jews , were killed , ever occurred . It is strongly supportive of the polemicist and Holocaust denial advocate David Irving . They believe that the world is run by a secret society of Jews . The League is distinctive for asserting that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a genuine Jewish document ( the Encyclopædi Britannica for example describes the Protocols as a "" fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century "" ) . The League describes itself as being based on the principles of Christianity and is vehement in its anti-communism . They argue in favour of capitalism by promoting the sanctity of private property and individual enterprise . They are keen promoters of Social Credit . They are strongly monarchist and completely opposed to Australian republicanism and see the links to Great Britain as being fundamental to Australian identity . The League has been accused of being associated with the now-defunct Australian National Socialist Party . Former Western Australian Labor MP , founder of the Australia First Party and later One Nation member Graeme Campbell was associated with the League at the same time as he was a member of One Nation and Australia First . Mr Campbell stated that "" Australia First has no association with the League . It 's me with the association . "" Former treasurer Peter Costello stated that One Nation 's policy of a state bank which would issue low-interest loans was directly taken from the ALOR , and that "" the League of Rights is driving its policy in relation to banking and money "" The Australian branch of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission issued a press release that "" The Co-founder of Australians Against Further Immigration ( AAFI ) , and One Nation 's Victorian leader Robyn Spencer has addressed numerous League of Rights meetings as well as delivered a speech with League of Rights , Advisory National Director Eric Butler . "" ALOR is also allegedly associated with National Action In the 1970s and early 1980s , the League attempted to gain control of the National Party of Australia , encouraging members to join the party in sufficient numbers to take control , a tactic known as entryism . Doug Anthony led an effort to defend the Party from the League by recruiting people who would vote against them . After a long struggle over several years , the existing leadership prevailed . A surprising consequence of this struggle was that the National Party , which got far fewer votes than either the Labor or Liberal parties , had more members . This fact became much more widely known than the reason for it , with both sides keeping the struggle out of the media . It has been associated with the now-defunct New Zealand League of Rights , the Canadian League of Rights and through the British League of Rights also the John Birch Society in the United States . Critics have pointed to the past participation of the League in the former World Anti-Communist League alongside dictatorial regimes like that of Augusto Pinochet .

The ORG is vehement in its anti-communism and it is based on the principles of MISC. Promoting the sanctity of private property and individual enterprise is what they argue for. Social Credit is something they are passionate about. They are opposed to MISC republicanism and see the links to LOC as fundamental to MISC identity. The ORG has been accused of being associated with something else. The founder of the ORG and later ORG member PER was associated with the ORG at the same time as he was with ORG and ORG. According to Mr PER, ORG has no association with the ORG. It's me with the association. The ORG's policy of a state bank which would issue low-interest loans was directly taken from the ORG, according to the former treasurer PER. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the ORG tried to gain control of the ORG, by encouraging members to join the party in sufficient numbers to take control. PER recruited people who would vote against the Party in the future. The existing leadership prevailed after a long battle. The ORG, which got far fewer votes than either the ORG or org parties, had more members. Both sides kept the struggle out of the media, as this fact became more widely known than the reason for it. It has been associated with the ORG, the ORG, and also the ORG in the LOC. Critics have pointed to the past participation of the ORG in the former ORG with dictatorial regimes. MISC 4  PER was issued in 1946.","The economic theory of Social Credit is expounded by PER and is the basis for the ORG. Affirming the virtues of freedom is what it describes as. It's not a political party but rather a watchdog against government intervention. The first of the Leagues of Rights based in the MISC states was based in the LOC from 1946 and formed the ORG in 1960. The founder of the ORG died in June of 2006 at the age of 90 The ORG does not agree with the idea that millions of people, particularly MISC, were killed. It is very supportive of the MISC denial advocate. The world is run by a secret society. The ORG is unique for asserting that the MISC is a genuine document, and that it served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century. The ORG is vehement in its anti-communism. Promoting the sanctity of private property and individual enterprise is one way they argue for capitalism. They are very active in promoting social credit. The links to LOC are fundamental to MISC identity and they are strongly monarchist and opposed to republicanism. The ORG has been accused of being associated with a different organization. The founder of the ORG and later ORG member PER was associated with the ORG at the same time he was associated with ORG and ORG. Mr PER stated that the ORG has no association with the ORG.

32,"The Ayalon Cave is a large underground limestone cave located near Ramla , Israel . The cave , 300 feet deep , with its branch extends almost 2.5 kilometres making it the second largest limestone cave in Israel . Researchers announced that they have so far discovered eight new species , all without eyes , including four crustacean species and four terrestrial species , previously unknown to science . They added that the crustaceans included two saltwater species and two freshwater species , indicating that this diversity might help better understand the water history of the region . The cave was first discovered when a small opening was discerned in a quarry near Ramla . According to Professor Amos Frumkin of the Hebrew University , the cave is unique in that a thick layer of chalk left it impermeable to water . The cave will remain closed to the public to allow scientific investigation to continue undisturbed . As the cave was completely cut off from the outside environment , it sustained an independent ecosystem ; this ecosystem did not rely on sunlight and photosynthesis , or on organic compounds , for an energy source . Rather , energy was extracted by Chemoautotrophic bacteria , living in a film on top of the pool water .

42,"The Battle of Vilcapugio was fought on October 1 , 1813 during the Campaign of Alto Peru in the Argentine War of Independence , where the pro-independence forces led by General Manuel Belgrano were defeated by the pro-Spanish Realists , led by Joaquin de la Pazuela . The Campaign was restarted upon the insistence of the government in Buenos Aires after the Army of the North 's victories during the Battles of Tucumán and Salta . Despite having malaria and having to command a company of new conscripts with insufficient artillery , Belgrano accepted the commanding post . Belgrano 's army was supported by Colonel Baltasar Cárdenas and the 2,000 poorly organized natives under his command , and Colonel Cornelio Zelaya with forces from Cochabamba . Both colonels had orders to incite rebellion amongst the indigenous populations who provided the realists with valuable information . Knowing that the realist army did not have enough mules to move its artillery and provisions , Belgrano planned to use a pincer movement to attack , confidently believing that Pezuela would not provide much resistance . At the end of September 1813 , most of Belgrano 's army arrived in the prairie of Vilcapugio , which was a plateau surrounded by tall mountains to the north of Potosí . The realist troops were encamped at Condo-Condo under the orders of Pazuela and Major Saturnino Castro , which allowed them to cut off Cárdenas ' troops and any communication between Belgrano and the Cochabamban forces . Castro also attained documents from Cárdenas giving instructions to Belgrano . With these documents Pazuela was able to interrupt Belgrano 's plans and began his advance on the mountains on October 1 . Belgrano 's army veterans from the North contained the left flank and center column of the realist army and forced them to back down until Pezuela recognized he was losing the battle at Virrey de Lima ; however , his own left flank remained in action and defeated Belgrano 's right column . The realist army reorganized itself and appropriated all of its artillery , continuously shelling the few soldiers left in Belgrano 's encampment . Belgrano and Eustaquio Díaz Vélez had decided that Vel would be the one to go to Potosí to reunite with the dispersed troops . Díaz Vélez took command over the troops in Potosí after Vilcapugio with the rest of the army on the left flank of the enemy . At this point the troops organized themselves to pursue the Campaign of Alto Perú according the orders of the government of Buenos Aires .",O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-PER O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O I-PER O O I-MISC O O I-PER O O O O I-PER O O O I-PER O O O O I-PER O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O I-PER O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O I-PER O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O I-LOC O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O,"The MISC MISC MISC was fought on October 1 , 1813 during the MISC MISC MISC MISC in the MISC MISC MISC MISC , where the pro-independence forces led by General PER PER were defeated by the MISC MISC , led by PER PER PER PER .

48,"Ben Player Ben is the current 2007 World Champion . He is known for his flawless bodyboarding style and massive charging . His victory came after placing second ( narrowly being defeated by Damian King ) in the 2006 Pipeline final . He has finished # 2 overall on the world bodyboarding tour several times . Ben now also helps run Movement Bodyboarding Magazine . The Shark Island Challenge is Australia 's richest bodyboarding competition , bankrolled to the tune of $120,000 . But as they say , money ca n't buy love -- or , as was the case in July 2005 , wave action . When the month-long waiting period ran out without a hint of swell , organisers were forced to put the outcome in the hands of competitors . And so the first stop on the World Bodyboarding Tour would be decided by a vote : either split the prize money and the championship points evenly between all competitors , or run the comp in the puny swell benignly flopping over a rock ledge usually famous for its forbidding risk to life and limb . "" I just thought , ' You fools , this is what we do ' , "" says Ben Player , one of only two pro riders who voted to compete . At 28 , he sensed his chances of ever winning a world title receding with each hand raised in opposition : he had fancied his chances at the infamous Island . Retreating to his car , he broke down and cried , angered and frustrated by his peers ' reluctance to man up at a spot that has always rewarded the brave . He paddled out anyway , an overt display of defiance against the group 's decision - albeit a failed one . "" I ended up cutting my hand pretty badly on the reef . It was n't rideable at all ... "" Six months later he was in Hawaii in January 06 for the final stop on the world tour . The irony of that frigid afternoon in Cronulla did n't dawn on Player as he paddled out in flawless , two-metre waves for the final of the Pipeline Pro ; he was too preoccupied with matters at hand . After further tour stops in Chile , Portugal and Maui , the two riders left in the hunt for the 2006 crown were the same pair who had voted in favour of going ahead at Shark Island - Ben Player and Queenslander Mitchell Rawlins . With Rawlins knocked out in the quarters , Ben needed to place at least second in the final to realise his dream of becoming world champ . His surfing in that 30-minute final was truly world class , combining clean barrels with solid boosts . Ben opened up a lead early that he would hold on to through to the siren . Not just the master of Pipeline , but champion of the world ... Then , further controversy . In the hazy , backlit conditions of the late afternoon , it was revealed that the judges had confused the riders , awarding Player the points for a ride his opponent had made . Scores were hastily revised , then the gutting news : Player had been relegated to runner-up , just moments before he was due to be presented with the Pipeline trophy . The confusion soured the occasion . But Ben Player was bodyboarding 's newest world champion . This month Player returns to Hawaii to defend his title . No such contest debacles this year , which means Ben Player is more ambitious than ever to win it clean . And again it will all come down to Pipeline , where his performances every winter since he first arrived as a wiry 16-year-old have made him a stand out , no matter what surfcraft you favour , as even the greatest surfer on the planet will attest . "" Ben gets a fair share of respect from the crew there , "" says Kelly Slater . "" He does n't really say all that much but seems to get the job done right . He has a good eye for how to ride a wave . A great surfer is a great surfer , no matter what they ride . "" That wiry frame has filled out during the 13 seasons he 's spent hassling for waves amongst the hungry pack of board riders who converge on the famous stretch of sand every northern winter . He shares physical traits with his brother Toby , also a pro bodyboarder and half the reason why the name Player has been tattooed on everything bodyboarding since the sport 's boom days of the mid-1990s . "" You ca n't help but be competitive with your brother , "" Ben says of their early years riding the wedging peaks of Whale Beach , on Sydney 's northern beaches . As the younger sibling , Ben was constantly surfing with guys his senior , something he feels refined his talent and drive . "" The fact Toby was more popular than me just made me even more competitive . "" In fact Ben Player 's biography reflects the twists and turns of the phenomenal growth of this comparatively new sport . Player won Australian titles as a cadet ( under-16s ) and as a pro in 2000 , part of the new generation that reshaped bodyboarding in Australia . This crew put new emphasis on style and fluidity in big moves and heavy situations , keeping their bodies and legs tight and in control through monstrous airs , milking power out of the pocket of the wave -- the bowl that forms in front of the barrelling section . His progressive riding and surfer-good looks made him the complete package , but at 24 , when he might have been cashing in , his seat at the head of bodyboarding 's table was kicked out from under him . At the start of the new millennium , surf brands began pulling out of bodyboarding . "" Three years ago I lost both sponsors on the same day . [ Surfwear label ] Quiksilver totally pulled out of bodyboarding and the company distributing Morey boards went bankrupt , so of course my contract went bust . Basically I lost $85,000 for that year and $35,000 that was owed to me , "" says Player . Player pinpoints Mike Stewart -- the undisputed guru of bodyboarding who had pioneered the sport -- for kick-starting an era of self-reliance and self-belief , backed by his call to "" support those who support bodyboarding "" . A kind of evangelistic patriotism swept through the sport . First came the launch of bodyboard-specific clothing brands , then wetsuits and accessories . Now bodyboarding specific stores have opened to cater for the newly independent industry . "" The sport is in a much better position now , "" Player will tell you . "" It 's still growing , but with the money remaining in bodyboarding . "" The thought of quitting never entered his head . "" It was more a question of ' How am I going to make ends meet ? "" He 'd always harboured a creative streak , was an avid scribe within the sport and a self-taught graphic designer ... The answer seems obvious now : Player pooled the last of his savings with a couple of friends and launched a magazine . "" The only other bodyboarding magazine on the market was aimed at a young teenage audience , and here I was 20-something and I could n't relate . I wanted to make something I could show people and say , ' Hey , this is what I do . ' "" For the first two years Player sold advertising for the mag , which was named Movement . It now employs four people ( yes , including this author ) . Player 's been able to step away from the day-to-day business , but the magazine is a venture that will keep him firmly rooted in the sport . It has even re-energised his passion for the sport . "" The more I worked on Movement the more stoked I became on bodyboarding again . "" As the street cred of bodyboarding evolved , so did the dynamics of the sport . Bodyboarders now seek out the sort of aquatic slabs breaking in shallow water that stand-up surfers leave alone . "" On a bodyboard you can handle much steeper situations . Being prone means you can ride over very shallow , ledging reefs , sometimes just inches deep , where you wo n't get knocked off by steps in the wave . "" This extreme element comes with heavy consequences . During a contest in Tahiti a few years ago , Player pulled into a barrel that shut down on him . When he finally came up for air , he was bleeding from both ears from the sheer pressure exerted by the imploding wave . "" I think surfing actually embraces bodyboarding much more now , because it 's not really seen as competition -- we 're something totally different , "" he says . "" We 're surfing our own waves and we 've got our own industry . "" The revamped world tour now showcases the sport at surf breaks that suit the craft . Shark Island is one of the best examples of this , the shallow rock bottom creating a warping barrel with an ideal end section which allows them to launch into aerial manoeuvres . The contest site in Chile is similar , though a true peak that barrels both ways . Then there is Hawaii 's Pipeline , the ideal of perfection whether you 're standing up or lying down . Portugal is the exception on the tour , a playful beach break , but it retains its status on the tour due to the carnival atmosphere that the sport attracts in Europe , as well as in South America . In Australia , the majority of top pros tend to remain nameless outside the sport 's domain ; in Europe they are feted like rock gods , mobbed by adoring fans wherever they go . The organisers of the world tour -- now chaired by Mr Bodyboarding himself , Mike Stewart -- say they are n't done yet with their expansion , but they 're certainly got the sport on its feet ... so to speak . But for now the eyes of the bodyboarding world are again squinting out towards the chunk of lava that lies submerged off the North Shore of Oahu . Mixed results on tour this year have Ben Player trailing on points in the race for the championship title , but he 's been in Hawaii for two months honing his act in preparation for his world title defence in mid-to-late January .

He has a flawless bodyboarding style and massive charging. He won after placing second in the 2006 MISC. He has finished in the top 2 on the world bodyboarding tour many times. PER now helps run org. LOC's richest bodyboarding competition is the MISC, which is bankrolled to the tune of $120,000. Money doesn't buy love as was the case in July 2005 When the waiting period ended without any swell, the outcome was in the hands of competitors. The first stop on the MISC would be decided by a vote, either split the prize money and the championship points evenly between all competitors, or run the comp over a rock ledge that is famous for its forbidding risk to life and limb. PER is one of only two pro riders who voted to compete. He thought his chances of ever winning a world title were over when he was 28. He broke down and cried as he retreated to his car, angry and frustrated by his peers' reluctance to man up at a spot that has always rewarded the brave. He paddled out anyway, despite the group's decision being a failed one. I cut my hand on the reef. It was not rideable. He was in LOC in January of 2006 for the final stop on the world tour. The irony of that frigid afternoon in LOC did not dawn on PER as he paddled out in flawless waves for the final of the MISC, he was too preoccupied with matters at hand. The two riders left in the hunt for the 2006 crown were the same pair who voted in favor of going ahead at LOC - PER and MISC PER. PER needed to place second in the final to realise his dream of becoming world champ after he was knocked out in the quarters. His surfing in the 30-minute final was truly world class. PER opened up a lead early and held on to it. The champion of the world is not just the master of MISC. Further controversy followed. In the hazy conditions of the late afternoon, it was revealed that the judges had confused the riders, awarding PER the points for a ride his opponent had made. Just moments before he was due to be presented with the MISC, PER was demoted to runner-up. The confusion soured the occasion. PER was bodyboarding's newest world champion. PER will defend his title this month. PER is more ambitious than ever to win it clean because there are no such debacles this year. Even the greatest surfer on the planet will attest to the fact that his performances every winter since he first arrived as a 16-year-old have made him a stand out. PER says that it gets a fair share of respect from the crew. He does say a lot but seems to get the job done right. He knows how to ride a wave. A surfer is a surfer no matter what they ride. He's spent the last 13 seasons hassling for waves amongst the hungry pack of board riders who converge on the famous stretch of sand every northern winter. The name PER has been tattooed on everything bodyboarding since the sport's boom days of the mid 1990s due to the physical similarities between him and his brother. PER says of their early years riding the wedging peaks of LOC, that they were competitive with their brother. PER was always surfing with his senior sibling, something he feels refined his talent and drive. The fact that PER was more popular than me made me even more competitive. PER's biography reflects the twists and turns of the phenomenal growth of this new sport. PER was part of the new generation that reshaped bodyboarding in LOC and won MISC titles as a cadet and pro. The crew put new emphasis on style and flexibility in big moves and heavy situations, keeping their bodies and legs tight and in control through monstrous airs. When he might have been cashing in, his seat at the head of bodyboarding's table was kicked out from under him. Surf brands began pulling out of bodyboarding at the start of the new millennium. I lost both sponsors on the same day three years ago. ORG pulled out of bodyboarding and the company distributing ORG boards went bankrupt, so of course my contract went bust. PER says that he lost $85,000 and $35,000 was owed to him. PER, the undisputed guru of bodyboarding who had pioneered the sport, backed by his call to support those who support bodyboarding, was pinpointed for kick-starting an era of self-reliance and self-belief. There was a kind of patriotism in the sport. wetsuits and accessories followed the launch of bodyboard-specific clothing brands. Bodyboarding specific stores have opened to cater for the independent industry. PER will tell you that the sport is in a better place now. With the money remaining in bodyboarding, it's still growing. The thought of quitting never entered his mind. He was an avid writer and a self-taught graphic designer. The answer seems obvious now that PER pooled the last of his savings with a couple of friends and launched a magazine.

PER will defend his title in this month. PER is more ambitious than ever to win it clean because there are no such contests this year. Even the greatest surfer on the planet will attest to the fact that his performances every winter since he first arrived at MISC have made him a stand out. PER says that they get a fair share of respect from the crew there. He does say a lot but seems to get the job done. He has a good idea of how to ride waves. A great surfer is a great surfer regardless of what they ride. During the 13 seasons he's spent hassling for waves amongst the hungry pack of board riders who converge on the famous stretch of sand every northern winter, he's filled out. The name PER has been tattooed on everything bodyboarding since the sport's boom days of the mid 1990s, due to the physical similarities between him and his brother PER. PER says of their early years riding the wedging peaks of LOC, that they were competitive with their brothers. PER was constantly surfing with his senior sibling, something that he feels refined his talent and drive. The fact PER was more popular than me made me more competitive. PER's biography reflects the twists and turns of the phenomenal growth of this sport. As a cadet, PER won MISC titles and as a pro, he was part of the new generation that reshaped bodyboarding. The crew put new emphasis on style and flexibility in big moves and heavy situations, keeping their bodies and legs tight and in control through monstrous airs, and using power out of the pocket of the wave -- the bowl that forms in front of the barrelling section When he might have been cashing in, his seat at the head of bodyboarding was kicked out from under him. Surf brands began pulling out of bodyboarding in the new millennium. Three years ago, I lost both sponsors in the same day. ORG pulled out of bodyboarding and the company distributing ORG boards went bankrupt so my contract went bust. PER says that he lost $85,000 for that year and that $35,000 was due to him. PER, the undisputed guru of bodyboarding who had pioneered the sport, is behind the call to support those who support bodyboarding. A kind of patriotism swept through the game. Bodyboard-specific clothing brands, wetsuits and accessories were launched. Bodyboarding specific stores have opened to cater for the new industry. PER will tell you that the sport is in better shape. With the money remaining in bodyboarding it is still growing. The thought of quitting never came to his mind. He'd always harboured a creative streak and was an avid writer within the sport. PER pooled the last of his savings with a couple of friends and launched a magazine The only other bodyboarding magazine on the market was aimed at a young teenage audience, and I could not relate. I wanted to show people what I do and that's why I made this. For the first two years, PER sold advertising for the mag. This author is one of four people it now employs. PER has been able to step away from the day-to-day business, but the magazine will keep him in touch with the sport. His passion for the sport has been regenerated. The more I worked on ORG, the more I bodyboarded. The street cred of bodyboarding evolved as the dynamics of the sport changed. Bodyboarders look for the sort of aquatic slabs breaking in shallow water that stand-up surfers don't. On a bodyboard, you can handle a lot of higher situations. Being prone means that you can ride over shallow reefs, where you can get knocked off by steps in the wave. This extreme element has heavy consequences. A few years ago, PER pulled into a barrel that shut him down during a contest. He was bleeding from his ears when he came up for air, because of the imploding wave. He says that surfing embraces bodyboarding more now that it's not seen as a competition. We're surfing our own waves. The sport at surf breaks suits the craft of the tour. One of the best examples of this is LOC, a shallow rock bottom creates a warping barrel with an ideal end section that allows them to launch into aerial maneuvers. The peak of the contest site in LOC is similar to the one in the US. Whether you're standing up or lying down, LOC's LOC is ideal. LOC is the exception on the tour, a playful beach break, but it retains its status due to the carnival atmosphere that the sport attracts in. In LOC, the majority of top pros don't get a lot of attention outside the sport's domain, but they are mobbed by fans wherever they go, and they're known as rock gods. The world tour is chaired by Mr Bodyboarding himself, PER, but they are still expanding. To say so. For now, the eyes of the bodyboarding world are looking at the chunk of lava that is submerged off the LOC. PER has been in LOC for two months honing his act in preparation for his world title defence in mid-to-late January, even though he is trailing in the race for the title. PER power would win the day if the waves stayed away and the top pros had to vote."

62,"It connected with the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad ( later Maine Central Railroad Mountain Division ) from Portland , Maine , to St. Johnsbury , Vermont , near the town of Hiram on the Saco River . B&SR design was based on experience of the Sandy River Railroad . Hinkley Locomotive Works modified their 2-foot gauge Forney design to run boiler first with an extended frame similar to that installed on Sandy River Railroad # 1 following a wreck in early 1882 . The successful design of the Bridgton Hinkleys was subsequently repeated for the Monson Railroad and the Franklin and Megantic Railway . Construction began in 1882 , and trains were running to Bridgton by early 1883 . B&SR used early profits to replace wooden trestles with earthen fills . A 14-foot granite masonry arch was constructed over Hancock Brook in 1895 . track was extended to Harrison with 35 # steel rails in 1898 . Trestles on the Harrison extension had been replaced by earthen fills and plate girder bridges by 1906 . Original Hinkley locomotives # 1-2 were replaced by # 5-6 of an improved design with pilot wheels . B&SR then replaced the original 30 # steel rails from Bridgton Junction to Bridgton with 48 # and 50 # steel rails from 1907 to 1910 before Maine Central Railroad secured control of the B&SR in 1912 . Under Maine Central operation , there were 4 mixed train round trips daily from Harrison to Bridgton Junction and return . The first left Harrison at 5:15 AM and the last returned to Harrison at 8:45 PM . Train speed seldom exceeded 20 miles per hour . Two passenger train sets were required for this service . The first consisted of baggage # 10 , RPO # 25 , and one or two coaches . A couple of bench seats at one end of baggage-RPO # 11 provided smoking accommodation for the second train set . Freight traffic in 1913 was 18% outbound lumber , 15% outbound pulpwood , 15% inbound coal , 11% outbound apples and canned corn , 11% manufactured goods , 10% feed & grain , 10% express , and 2% inbound petroleum products . Locomotive # 8 was the last locomotive built for the Maine 2-foot gauge railways . Bond interest went unpaid in 1926 , and the town of Bridgton began a 15-year effort to preserve their railroad . The B&SR was reorganized as the Bridgton and Harrison ; but the extension to Harrison was dismantled after locomotive # 8 tipped over when the 35 # rails sagged in 1930 . Locomotive # 8 was the heaviest locomotive on any 2-foot gauge railway in Maine . B&SR became a tourist attraction as the last 2-foot gauge railroad offering passenger service in the late 1930 's . Operation ceased in September 1941 . The rolling stock was preserved when the rails were converted to scrap metal as the United States prepared for World War II . The rolling stock was moved to Massachusetts for another half-century of operation on the Edaville Railroad after the war . There are still signs of the B&SR evident in a few places if one searches carefully for them . Milepost 0 : Bridgton Junction - Interchange yard with the Portland and Ogdensburg ( later Maine Central Railroad Mountain Division . ) Agent 's station shared with Maine Central Railroad . B&SR had 6 northbound spurs plus a turntable with a single-stall enginehouse . The freight house spur was dual gauge , and there was a second dual gauge spur for loading and unloading narrow gauge-equipment on standard-gauge cars . There was no runaround track ; so southbound B&SR locomotives uncoupled their train on the main line , moved into the yard , threw a turnout , and let their train roll past them into the yard by gravity to avoid being trapped at the end of the spur . Milepost 0.8 : Scribner 's - southbound spur . Milepost 1 : granite masonry arch over Hancock Brook . Milepost 1.2 : Small 's Milepost 2.0 : Rankin 's Mill - small flag stop passenger shelter . Milepost 2.7 : Mullen Siding - northbound spur . Milepost 3 : Summit - highest point on the railroad . Milepost 4 : Fill over the north end of Barker pond with granite masonry abutments for a short timber stringer span on the boundary between Hiram and the town of Sebago . Milepost 4.4 : Twin Lake - small flag stop passenger shelter . Milepost 5.4 : Gravel Pit - northbound spur . Milepost 7 : The Notch - a rock cut . Milepost 7.2 : West Sebago - southbound spur with small flag stop passenger shelter . Milepost 7.5 : Water Tank Siding - passing siding adjacent to Hancock Pond . The main line ran between Hancock Pond and B&SR superintendent Joseph Bennett 's lakeside cottage a short distance south of the covered water tank . Milepost 9.0 : Perley 's Mills - southbound spur with small flag stop passenger shelter . Milepost 10.5 : Ingall 's Road - southbound spur with small flag stop passenger shelter . Milepost 11.3 : Kennett 's - southbound spur . Milepost 12.1 : South Bridgton - southbound spur with small flag stop passenger shelter . Milepost 13 : high fill with granite masonry abutments for a short timber stringer span over Willett Brook . Milepost 13.5 : Sandy Creek - agent 's station with passing siding serving a sawmill . Milepost 15.8 : Bridgton - had the largest population of any village served by the Maine 2-foot gauge railroads . The yard was on the stub of a wye with branches to Harrison and Bridgton Junction . There were 2 storage sidings and 4 spurs serving the agent 's station , a separate freight house , a team track , an oil distributor , a grain store , the B&SR shop , and a turntable with a 4-stall enginehouse . Milepost 15.9 : Farmers Market - two northbound spurs ( one was a coal trestle . ) Milepost 16.4 : Forest Mills -- passing siding with a northbound coal trestle spur . Milepost 19.5 : North Bridgton - agent 's station with passing siding serving a separate freight house . Milepost 20.7 : Harrison - agent 's station with a passing siding and several southbound spurs serving a freight house , a cannery , a grain store , a 2-track car shed , and a turntable with a single-stall enginehouse . Baggage car # 10 later renumbered # 31 Baggage car # 11 later renumbered # 30 Coach # 18 purchased from Wiscasset , Waterville and Farmington Railway in 1911 . RPO # 25 was badly damaged in a collision with locomotive # 7 in the Bridgton yard about 1927 . The larger smoking compartment was rebuilt to carry express with a single baggage door on only one side of the car ; and the smaller RPO compartment was rebuilt with a few seats to carry passengers . The car was sold for use as a restaurant in 1935 . The appearance of locomotive # 7 was permanently changed by replacement of a smaller number plate on the front of the boiler . Flat cars # 2-13 were the largest flat cars on any 2-foot gauge railway in Maine . Flat car # 21 was fitted with a 3,000 gallon oil tank for the Standard Oil Company of New York in 1920 . The tank was later transferred to flat car # 14 when # 21 was scrapped . Flat car # 22 was fitted with a 2,500 gallon oil tank for the Standard Oil Company in 1901 . Cars # 22 and # 21/14 were the only 2-foot gauge tank cars in Maine . Flat cars # 35 , 38 , and 41-42 were rebuilt by B&SR to a length of 28 feet when they required repairs . Flat car # 40 was rebuilt as a flanger . Box cars # 56-58 had two small hinged doors on either side which could be opened as windows when transporting livestock . Box cars # 59-62 were the first 30-foot freight cars built for any 2-foot gauge railroad in Maine . Box cars # 71-73 were the largest box cars on any 2-foot gauge railway in Maine .",O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O I-LOC O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O,"It connected with the LOC LOC LOC LOC ( later LOC LOC LOC LOC LOC ) from LOC , LOC , to LOC LOC , LOC , near the town of LOC on the LOC LOC .

Baggage car # 10 later renumbered # 31 Baggage car # 11 later renumbered # 30 Coach # 18 purchased from LOC in 1911 The locomotive # 7 was damaged in a collision with the RPO # 25 in 1927. The larger smoking compartment was rebuilt to carry express baggage with a single baggage door on only one side of the car, and the smaller RPO compartment was rebuilt with a few seats to carry passengers. In 1935 the car was sold for use as a restaurant. The locomotive # 7 had a smaller number plate on the front of the boiler replaced. Flat cars # 2-13 were the largest flat cars on a 2-foot gauge railway. The ORG of LOC had a 3,000 gallon oil tank for the flat car # 21. When # 21 was scrapped, the tank was moved to a flat car. There was a 2,500 gallon oil tank for the ORG in 1901. There were only two 2-foot gauge tank cars in the LOC. Flat cars # 35, 38, and 41-42 were rebuilt by LOC to a length of 28 feet when they required repairs. Flat car # 40 was rebuilt. There were two small hinged doors on either side of the box car, which could be used to open the windows. The first 30-foot freight cars were built for the LOC. Box cars # 71- 73 were the largest on the railway.","It was near the town of LOC on the LOC and connected with the LOC. LOC design was based on experience. The Forney design was modified to run boiler first with an extended frame like the one on LOC # 1 after a wreck in early 1882. The design of the MISC was repeated for both the LOC and the LOC. The trains were running to LOC by the early 1890s. LOC replaced wooden trestles with earthen fills. In 1895, a 14-foot granite masonry arch was constructed. In 1898 the track was extended to LOC with steel rails. By 1906, the LOC extension had been replaced by plates girder bridges. An improved design with pilot wheels replaced the original org locomotives. LOC secured control of the LOC in 1912 after replacing the original 30 # steel rails from LOC to LOC with 48 # and 50# steel rails from LOC to LOC. There were 4 mixed train round trips daily from LOC to LOC. The first left at 5 am and the last came back at 8:45 pm. The train speed was usually 20 miles per hour. Two passenger train sets were needed. Baggage # 10, RPO # 25 and one or two coaches were the first items. A couple of bench seats at one end of baggage allowed smoking during the second train set. In 1913, freight traffic included 18% outbound lumber, 15% outbound pulpwood, 15% inbound coal, 11% outbound apples and canned corn, and 10% express. Locomotive # 8 was the last locomotive to be built. The town of LOC began a 15-year effort to preserve their railroad after bond interest went unpaid in 1926. The extension to the LOC was dismantled after locomotive # 8 tipped over when the 35 rails sagged in 1930. Locomotive # 8 was the most heavy locomotive on the railway. The last 2-foot gauge railroad that offered passenger service in the late 1930's became a tourist attraction. In September 1941, the operation ended. The rails were converted to scrap metal and that preserved the rolling stock. After the war, the rolling stock was moved to the LOC for another fifty years. If one searches carefully, there are still signs of the LOC in some places. The interchange yard with the LOC is called the Milepost 0. The agent's station is shared with LOC. There were 6 spurs and a single-stall enginehouse in the LOC. There was a dual gauge spur for loading and unloading narrow gauge equipment on standard gauge cars in the freight house. Locomotives uncoupled their train on the main line, moved into the yard, threw a turnout, and let their train roll past them to avoid being trapped at the end of the spur. Scribner's is the spur that leads to the milepost 0.8. Milepost 1 has a granite masonry arch. Milepost 1.2 : Small's Milepost 2.0 : LOC - small flag stop passenger shelter The spur of the milepost is called the Mullen Siding. The Summit is the highest point on the railroad.

71,"The capture gun , also called a dart gun , is an invention which was refined by a team headed by Dr Tony Pooley and Dr Toni Harthoorn in Kenya in the early 1960 's . Since then it has become the standard tool for capture of large and medium-sized animals to transport them safely . The original piston-operated medium-bore gun fired a tranquilizer dart which is a syringe which was loaded with a dose of barbiturate and / or other drugs , backed by a ball bearing which was separated from the drug mix with a wadding . On impact with the animal the inertial momentum of the balls injects the drug into the animal , causing torpor and prostration within minutes . Because of the power of the drugs the handlers then have to move quickly to secure the animal for transport , monitor its vital signs , protect its eyes and ears , and then inject reversing drugs when needed . Many large animals are acutely sensitive to stress and can easily die without careful treatment . One major discovery by Dr Harthoorn 's team was that different species , despite being of roughly equal size ( for example the rhinoceros and the buffalo ) needed very different doses and spectra of drugs to safely immobilise them .

74,"Carmen Cavallaro ( May 6 , 1913 -- October 12 , 1989 ) was an American pianist born in New York . He established himself as one of the most accomplished and admired light music pianists of his generation . Known as the "" Poet of the Piano "" , Carmen Cavallaro showed a gift for music from age 3 , picking out tunes on a toy piano . His parents were encouraged by a friend to develop the child 's musical talents and he studied classical piano in the United States . As a young pianist , he toured Europe performing in many capitals . In 1933 , Cavallaro joined the jazz band of Al Kavelin , where he quickly became the featured soloist . After four years he switched to a series of other big bands , including Rudy Vallee 's in 1937 . He also worked briefly with Enrico Madriguera and Abe Lyman . Starting his own band , a five-piece combo , in St. Louis in 1939 , his popularity grew and his group expanded into a 14-piece orchestra , releasing some 19 albums for Decca over the years . Although his band traveled the country and played in all the top spots , he made a particular impact at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco , which became a favourite venue , and which many years later , was to be re-visited in the same way by George Shearing and Mel Tormé . Other venues where he drew large and devoted audiences included New York 's Waldorf-Astoria , Chicago 's Palmer House and the Los Angeles ' Coconut Grove . In 1963 , he had a million seller hit with the song Sukiyaki .

His musical interests and arrangements included dance music , particularly Latin rhythms , tangos and strict tempo dancing styles , as well as some pop and jazz arrangements of classical melodies . In this , he is often cited as being influenced by pianist Eddy Duchin . Liberace was greatly influenced by both Cavallaro and Duchin . All three shared a propensity for arranging classical piano themes in a pop idiom . Cavallaro also became famous through the medium of radio and film , firstly with his regular program on NBC during the 1940 's , The Schaeffer Parade , of which he was the host and later in films where he played himself , starting with Hollywood Canteen ( 1944 ) , then Diamond Horseshoe ( 1945 ) and Out of This World ( 1945 ) .

80,"Chad Edward Gaudin ( pronounced go-DAN ) ( born March 24 , 1983 in New Orleans , Louisiana ) is a right-handed starting pitcher for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball . Gaudin attended Crescent City High School in Metairie , Louisiana . He earned All-State and district MVP in his junior and senior years . Gaudin was selected by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays right out of high school in the 34th round ( 1009th overall pick ) of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft . He signed on August 23 , 2001 and did not play professionally until 2002 . He played in Single A in 2002 and recorded a 2.26 ERA which ranked him 10th in all of minor league baseball . On July 15 , 2003 , in his first start after getting called up from the Class A California League , Gaudin took the mound in the first game of a doubleheader for the AA Orlando Rays on the road against the Jacksonville Suns and threw a 7-inning perfect game , retiring all 21 batters he faced . ( Two 7-inning games is the standard for a doubleheader in most minor leagues ; Major League Baseball would later amend a rule recognizing only efforts of at least nine innings as official perfect games . ) Gaudin made only two more starts and posted an 0.47 ERA for Orlando before Devil Rays ' Manager Lou Piniella summoned him to the big league club . When Gaudin made his major league debut , he had become the youngest Devil Ray in club history at 20 years and 4 months and was the 4th youngest player in the majors . After posting a very respectable 2-0 record and 3.60 ERA in 15 appearances ( including 3 starts ) in 2003 for the Devil Rays , he went 1-2 with a 4.85 ERA in 26 appearances ( 4 starts ) in 2004 while splitting time with AAA Durham . On December 12 , 2004 , Gaudin was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for backup catcher Kevin Cash . Although he pitched well as a starter at AAA Syracuse , he was just 1-3 with a 13.15 ERA in 5 appearances ( 3 starts ) with the Blue Jays . Opponents had batted .470 against him in just 13 innings ( 31 hits ) . On December 5 , 2005 , he was traded to the Athletics for a player to be named later , who later turned out to be outfielder Dustin Majewski . Gaudin began the 2006 season for the Sacramento River Cats , the Athletics Triple A team . He was recalled by the Athletics after posting an 0.37 ERA in 4 starts for the River Cats and pitched in relief for the rest of the season for the big league club . In his first season as an Athletic , he posted various career highs and his ERA ( 3.09 ) and opponents batting average were the lowest of his career . His inherited runners to score was 20 percent which ranked fourth lowest in the American League . In 2007 , Gaudin was converted into a starter again when veteran Esteban Loaiza was on the disabled list to begin the season . His excellent performance as a starter in the 2007 season has made him part of the new ' Big Three ' that include Dan Haren and Joe Blanton .",I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-PER O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O,"PER PER PER ( pronounced go-DAN ) ( born March 24 , 1983 in LOC LOC , LOC ) is a right-handed starting pitcher for the ORG ORG of ORG ORG ORG .

89,"Christopher Penley ( born circa 1990 --- January 15 2006 ) was a 15-year-old U.S. schoolboy who was shot by a SWAT team on January 13 , 2006 --- and died of his injuries --- after he had briefly taken another student hostage in a classroom and then later holed himself up in an outdoor bathroom at Milwee Middle School in Longwood , Florida , with an Airsoft gun painted entirely black to disguise it as a Beretta 9mm . After the gun was discovered by a fellow student , he forced the student into the closet and shut off the lights in the classroom .

90,"Circuit Park Zandvoort is a motorsport race track located in the dunes near the town of Zandvoort , in the Netherlands , near the North Sea coast line . Although there were plans for races at Zandvoort before World War II , the first street race was held on June 3 , 1939 . A real circuit was not built until after the war , mainly designed by John Hugenholtz . The circuit was inaugurated on August , 7 , 1948 . Next year , in 1949 the circuit hosted the Zandvoort Grand Prix . It remained on the F1 calendar for 30 out of the next 34 years . The company that commercially ran the circuit ( CENAV ) went out of business , marking the end of Circuit Zandvoort . The track , owned by the municipality of Zandvoort , was not used for some time and part of the grounds and approximately half of the track was sold in 1987 to Vendorado , a Bungalow park developer at that time . A plan to save the remaining track was made by a group of people and companies . In 1995 , CPZ got the "" A Status "" of the Dutch government and began building an international Grand Prix Circuit . One of the major events that is currently held at the circuit , along with DTM and A1GP , is the BP Ultimate Masters of Formula 3 , where Formula 3 cars of several national racing series compete with each other ( originally called Marlboro Masters , before tobacco advertising ban ) . The most famous corner in the circuit is the Tarzanbocht ( Tarzan corner ) which provides excellent overtaking opportunities . This corner is reportedly named after a local character who had earned the nickname of Tarzan and only wanted to give up his vegetable garden in the dunes if the track 's designers named a nearby corner after him . On the other hand , many different stories about Tarzan Corner are known . Circuit Park Zandvoort played host to the first race in the 2006/07 season of A1 Grand Prix from 29 September - 1 October 2006 . In the history of the circuit , several fatal accidents have occurred . The older ' Classic ' Zandvoort circuit layout from 1967 is modeled in detail and can be driven in the Grand Prix Legends racing simulation for X86-based pc's . This was later converted to NASCAR 4 , NASCAR 2002 , 2003 and other simulations using a converter from website ' The Pits ' . The current layout is used in the SimBin game RACE 07 - Official WTCC Game .",I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O I-LOC O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O,"LOC LOC LOC is a motorsport race track located in the dunes near the town of LOC , in the LOC , near the LOC LOC coast line .

96,"The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ( CSHL ) is a private , non-profit institution with research programs focusing on cancer , neurobiology , plant genetics , genomics and bioinformatics . The Laboratory has a broad educational mission , including the recently established Watson School of Biological Sciences . Seven Nobel laureates have been associated with the lab . Though the lab 's name and address reference the town "" Cold Spring Harbor "" located in Suffolk County , Long Island , New York , its headquarters are in fact physically located in the adjacent Nassau County village of Laurel Hollow .. The laboratory began its history in 1890 as an extension of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences ; in 1904 , the Carnegie Institution of Washington established the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor on the site . In 1921 , the station was reorganized as the Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics . The Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics scientists at Cold Spring Harbor made innumerable contributions to the sciences of genetics , medicine , and the then-infant science of molecular biology , and in 1962 its facilities merged with those of The Brooklyn Institute 's Biological Laboratory to create what is known today as Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory . In 1944 Barbara McClintock discovered at CSHL transposons ( "" jumping genes "" ) , for which she received the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . One well-known aspect of the Laboratory is its hosting of the experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase , and the work of Max Delbrüc and Salvado Luria . Another Nobel laureate scientist there was Richard J. Roberts . Nobel laureate James D. Watson ( who co-discovered the double helix structure of DNA with Francis Crick ) served as the Laboratory 's Director and President for 35 years , and later assumed the role of Chancellor . In October 2007 Watson resigned as a result of controversial remarks about race made to The Sunday Times in the U.K . Currently , cancer biologist Bruce Stillman serves as laboratory President . During the years 1910 to 1940 , the laboratory was also the home of the Eugenics Record Office of biologist Charles B. Davenport and his assistant Harry H. Laughlin , two prominent American eugenicists of the period . In 1935 the Carnegie Institution sent a team to review their work , and as a result the ERO was ordered to stop all efforts . In 1939 the Institute withdrew funding for the ERO entirely , leading to its closure . Their reports , articles , charts , and pedigrees were considered scientific "" facts "" in their day , but have since been discredited . However , this closure came 15 years after its findings were incorporated into the National Origins Act ( Immigration Act of 1924 ) , which severely reduced the number of immigrants to America from southern and eastern Europe who , Harry Laughlin testified , were racially inferior than the Nordic immigrants from England and Germany . Aside from its scientific mission , the laboratory is host to world-class scientific conferences on a variety of topics . The first of the annual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Symposium on Quantitative Biology was held in 1934 . The Symposium in 1960 , Biological Clocks , was arguably the founding moment of the field of chronobiology . Now , over 24 meetings , in addition to the Symposium , for between 200 and 500 scientists , are held annually . The Banbury Center is a small conference center that holds discussion-style meetings for only 36 invited participants . These elite meetings cover often controversial topics in molecular biology and neuroscience . Salvador Luria and Max Delbrüc founded the Phage Course in 1948 , a course that trained many of the leaders of the new field of molecular genetics . The courses proliferated under Watson 's guidance and each year some 28 advanced courses are held for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who travel to CSHL from throughout the world . The laboratory also offers many programs for students in high school and college in biotechnology and biology . The lab is particularly well known for its contributions towards the training of young scientists , notably through the establishment of its Undergraduate Research Program in 1959 , its Dolan DNA Learning Center in 1988 , and the founding of the Watson School of Biological Sciences in 1998 .",O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O I-MISC O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-LOC O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-LOC O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O I-MISC O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O,"The ORG ORG ORG ORG ( ORG ) is a private , non-profit institution with research programs focusing on cancer , neurobiology , plant genetics , genomics and bioinformatics .

99,"Connecticut Classic Lotto is one of the games offered by the Connecticut Lottery . It is drawn twice a week , on Tuesdays and Fridays . The earliest version of the game began in 1983 as a pick-6-of-36 . Later it became a 6/40 game . The current 6/44 matrix was adopted in September 1989 . The in-state game underwent further changes , such as adding a cash option in 1997 , and switching to what proved to be an unpopular "" wild card "" version in 1998 . The name was changed to "" Classic Lotto "" , and the wild card ball disappeared , in May 1999 . The current game ( as of 2007 ) pays winners $2 for matching three numbers , with parimutuel prizes for matching more numbers . The jackpot is won if all six match . Top-prize winners choose lump sum or annuity within 60 days of claiming the jackpot . In the unlikely event that the annuity is chosen , the prize is paid in 21 yearly installments . The overall prize pool is 52% of sales , half of which goes toward the jackpot alone . As with all Connecticut Lottery games , the minimum age to play Classic Lotto is 18 . The Classic Lotto jackpot was most recently hit on June 8 , 2007 ; the jackpot is almost never shared by two or more tickets . Winners of Classic Lotto ( jackpot or otherwise ) have one year to claim their prizes . A Classic Lotto jackpot of $3.5 million ( annuity ) on a ticket bought in February 2006 went unclaimed . The Connecticut Lottery had several options for distributing the $2.1 million cash that would have funded the jackpot prize ; as of June 2007 , there has been no official word as to what the money will be used for . It is possible the money will go into future Classic Lotto drawings ; for a time in the mid-to-late 1990s , unclaimed jackpot cash was used to guarantee starting jackpots of $2 million , instead of the usual $1 million .

103,"Crazyhead are an English punk rock / garage rock band from Leicester . Though lumped in with the latgely media-created Grebo scene , they were more influenced by the Garage Rock of the late 60 's , as well as bands like The Ramones , The Stooges and Captain Beefheart . They described themselves as an "" urban bastard blues band "" , and their songs ranged in theme from trenchant social commentary to the surreal , but always with an underlying vein of black humour . who were credited as "" The Phantom Horns "" or "" The Space Bastards "" . Formed in 1986 , they signed to independent label Food later that year and their début single "" Wha Gives You The Idea That You 're So Amazing , Baby ? "" reached number 2 in the UK Indie Chart in March 1983 . For the rest of the year they toured extensively , supporting The Cult , then Julian Cope , and also played the Glastonbury Festival . Their second single "" Baby Turpentine "" reached number 4 in the Indie Chart . In mid-1988 their third single "" Time Has Taken Its Toll On You "" reached # 65 in the Top 100 , their label now owned by EMI . The band embarked on another UK tour to promote their début album Deser Orchid , released in Octobe 1988 , along with another single , "" Rags "" , and then toured Europe supporting Iggy Pop . They then released the Have Love Will Travel EP ( which reached # 68 ) before embarking on yet another UK tour . In 1989 they made two brief tours of the United States , and appeared at the Reading Festival . At the behest of the British Council , they played an international music festival in Moscow , USSR , and in early 1990 , along with Skin Games and Jesus Jones were one the first western bands to tour post-Ceauşescu Romania . Later that year they played at the Namibian Independence Day concert to an audience of 50,000 . The band were dropped by Food Records in 1989 , and their second album Some Kind Of Fever was released through Revolver Records . In 1992 they gigged across Europe , and in 1993 embarked on a tour of the UK in order to promote an album of cover versions Live In Memphis , even though the deal to release it fell through . Over the next few years Crazyhead made sporadic live appearances . In 1997 they released Fucked By Rock - a collection of previously unreleased material , demo versions , and live tracks , and an EP of new material 13th Floor .

The three founding members , Ronan Gaughan , Ruairi Ferrie and former drummer Ruairi Cavanagh originally hail from Galway . Later members Arran Murphy is from Wicklow , while newest recruit , Camera Shanahan , comes from Dublin . The band 's music has been described as electro / synthpop with a slightly sombre overtone and introverted lyrical sensibility . According to Village they "" seem to gather comparisons with the murkier side of electro pop , usually bands like New Order , Interpol or Joy Division . While the comparisons have some basis , DRN are far from gloomy , just a bit ... cool. .. But this cool does not translate into pretension , just humorous and knowledgeable asides to their favourite artists , photographers and filmmakers "" . Dark Room Notes formed in Galway in 2004 , recruiting drummer Shanahan in 2006 . They performed their first gig in Galway in December 2006 .

Budjana 's style changed dramatically to jazz as he got to know John McLaughlin , Pat Metheny , Jeff Beck , John Abercrombie , Chick Corea and Weather Report . In his early experience , he established a band called "" Squirrell "" which was popular in the local community . Throughout his musical experience in Indonesia , Dewa Budjana has collaborated with many famous guitarists such as Tohpati , Ridho and Abdee Negara . His ability to combine jazz and rock has put him among the top Indonesian guitarists . Budjana 's passion and talent in music , especially guitar , has been very dominant since he was in an elementary school in Klungkung , Bali . Budjana 's first teacher was a construction worker who lived nearby . He stole money from his grandmother to buy his first guitarHe prioritised guitar in his life , and started to teach himself by playing rock songs . He became more passionate about music , and was reflected when Budjana moved to Surabaya , East Java , where he took a classical music course , performed with a band and participated in many of music performances . After graduation , he went to Jakarta to pursue a career as professional musician . While there , he came across Jack Lesmana , a jazz maestro and father of jazz musician Indra Lesmana , who taught Budjana the philosophy of jazz . In 1976 , when he was thirteen , Budjana 's name started to be seen in the music world in Surabaya . Later , in 1981 , he bought a "" real "" electric guitar ( an Aria Pro II ) and started to play with many different people . Slowly , his musical style changed from pop rock to jazz , as he started to incorporate influences from John McLaughlin of the Mahavishnu Orchestra , Chick Corea , Yes , Gentle Giant , Kansas , Tangerine Dream , American Garage , Bright Size Life , Pat Metheny and Allan Holdsworth . In 1980 , Budjana started Squirrel , his first jazz band , with his schoolmates in Surabaya . Squirrel participated in a number of national music events , including Light Music Contest in 1984 at Teater Terbuka , TIM , Indonesia . Though many contestants participated , it was Budjana and his fellow bandmates who outperformed the competition and won . One year after that , Budjana decided to fly to Jakarta in order to expand his music career . This journey lead him to Jack Lesmana , an Indonesian jazz legend , who introduced him to other professional musicians . Although Jack provided Budjana with opportunities in his Indonesian music career , it was Indra who first asked him to became a session player . A few years later , Budjana joined the band Spirit , which included Baron , Gigi 's former guitarist . With Budjana , Spirit released one self-titled album , before Budjana decided to leave the band and joined Java Jazz . He also sat in with many other bands --- including the Jimmy Manopo Band , Erwin Gutawa , Elfa 's Big Band and Twilite Orchestra --- and participated in the North Sea Jazz Festival , a world jazz convention in Den Haag , the Netherlands . His current band , Gigi , was formed in 1994 with Baron ( guitar ) , Thomas ( bass ) , Armand ( vocal ) and Ronald ( drum ) . Since then , Gigi has released six albums . He has also released his own solo albums : Nusa Damai ; Gitarku ; Samsara ; and Home , a tribute album to the December 2004 tsunami victims . Since Dewa Budjana started his professional career as a musician , he has mainly used a Parker Fly Delux as his main guitar , occasionally using Klein and Gibson guitars SG series instead . Budjana also owns a double neck Klein guitar which was used on his latest album , Home , and pictured on the CD cover . For his rig , Dewa Budjana mainly uses Mesa Boogie rectifier and Carvin Legacy amplifier that are connected to the Line 6 Ax2 212 .",I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O I-PER O I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-ORG I-ORG O I-PER I-PER O I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O I-PER O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-ORG I-ORG O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O I-PER O O O O I-MISC O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O I-ORG O O O I-PER O I-ORG O O O O O I-PER O I-ORG O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O I-LOC O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O I-PER O O O O I-PER O O O O I-PER O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O I-MISC O I-MISC O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O I-PER O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O,"PER PER PER PER or PER PER ( born August 30 , 1963 in LOC ) is an MISC guitarist , songwriter and composer .

119,"Diego Silang y Andaya ( December 16 , 1730 - May 28 , 1763 ) was raised as an Ilocano ; his father was Pangasinense . He was a revolutionary leader who conspired with British forces to overthrow the Spanish in the northern Philippines and establish an independent Ilocano nation . His revolt was fueled by grievances stemming from Spanish tributes and abuses , and his belief in self-government , that the administration and leadership of the Roman Catholic Church and government in the Ilocos Region ( which at this time did not include Pangasinan ) should be led by trained Ilocano officials . Born in Aringay , Pangasinan ( an area in present-day Caba or Aringay , La Union ) , he worked as a messenger for a local Castilian priest in Vigan , Ilocos Sur . Bright , passionate and fluent in Spanish , he ferried correspondence from the Ilocos to Manila , journeys that gave him his first glimpse of colonial injustice and that planted the seeds of rebellion . Spain allied with France during the Seven Years ' War against Great Britain . In so doing , the British sought to diminish the Spanish Empire .

123,"The island of Divar ( Divar-derived from the word Dipavati or ' small Island ' in Konkani ) lies in the state of Goa , India . It is located approximately 10 km from Panaji ( Panjim ) , and is approachable by ferry . The Island is connected to Old Goa on the south-east side , Ribandar , on the south-west side and Narve on the north side , all by ferry . A launch also connects Divar to the city of Panaji from further north-west , in the village of Vanxim . The Konkan Railway passes through the village and the nearest stop to the village is the train station at Karmali . The drive to the village is scenic , with paddy fields and wooded hills lacing the roadway , very typical of the Goan countryside . Though in a manner equally typical of modern Goa , of late the paddy fields lie fallow and overrun with weeds . The Island of Divar was a famous site of Hindu pilgrimage and hosted the the ancient temples of Shree Saptakoteshwar , Shree Ganesh and Shree Dwarkeshwar besides others . These were irreversibly destroyed by Portuguese zealots in the 16th century in their drive for Christianisation of Goa . The ancient site of Hindu pilgrimage is called Porne Tirth ( Old pilgrim spot-in Konkani ) even today . Rui Gomez Pereira in his book Goan temples and deities writes , "" The original temple ( Of Shree Saptakoteshwar ) was constructed in the 12th century by the kings of Kadamba dynasty . Shree Saptakoteshwar was the patron Deity of the Kadambas . It was destroyed by the sultan of the Deccan in the middle of the 14th century and reconstructed at the same locality by Madhav Mantri of Vijaynagar at the close of the same century . It was again destroyed by the Portuguese in 1540 . "" The Saptakoteshwar idol was shifted to Narve in Bicholim after the destruction of the temple by the Portuguese . The present temple in Narve , Bicholim was rebuilt by ShivajiRaje Bhonsale the Great Maratha leader . A Jesuit priest Fr Francisco Sousa documented the religious importance of "" Divar "" in his book Oriente Conquistado ( Conquest of the orient ) around the latter quarter of the 16th or early 17th century . Fr. Sousa testifies that "" Divar was as much venerated by the Hindu Brahmins as the Holy land by us , on account of a temple of many indulgences and pilgrimages. .. "" Rui Gomez Pereira details further stating , "" The linga of the temple , made of five metals - gold , silver , copper , iron and bronze "" was later relocated in Bicholim . And on the foundations of the same temple a prayer and catechism house was constructed in 1563 , which was later transformed into the chapel of Our Lady of Cande laria . "" The original inhabitants of this island were people who once lived in Old Goa but had to desert during a disastrous pest that greatly reduced the population of Old Goa . Piedade , a small village is spread at the bottom of a small forested hillock on which there is the Church of Our Lady of Compassion . The island is dotted with well maintained , elegant Portuguese villas . From the top of the hill , superb panoramic views of the surrounding countryside , including Old Goa , the capital of Goa , Panaji , the meandering Mandovi river , and the bridges across it can be seen . The famous Bonderam festival is celebrated in Divar on the fourth Saturday of August during the monsoon with great fanfare and attended by thousands of tourists and locals . Bonderam Festival : The festival is a memoir to the dispute and the fury of the Villagers over the Portuguese system of resolving the disputes . The villagers on the Divar Island often indulged in some kind of fight over the matter of ownership of their lands . To stop the disputes the Portuguese , put up flags at the boundaries . The villagers did not like this system . So they protested against the Portuguese by throwing stones at the flags . On this day a carnival ambience is created . Each section of the village has a float at the parade . Melodious music could be heard throughout the village . The gaily colored floats accompanied by colorfully dressed youngsters make a pretty picture . The huge bell which today adorns the Se Cathedral in Old Goa was originally donated by the master of a sinking ship who 'd made a vow that , were he to survive his fate , he would donate the ship 's bell to the first church village , town , or city his vessel touched . It so happened that that island was Divar . In keeping with his promise , he donated the bell to the church of Divar , which is located on a high hillock . Unfortunately though , every time the bell was struck , it shattered the windows of the church and the houses in the vicinity , so a deal was struck and the bell was exchanged with that of the Se Cathedral .",O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O I-MISC O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O I-MISC O O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O I-PER O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-MISC O O O I-MISC O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O I-LOC O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O,"The island of LOC ( Divar-derived from the word Dipavati or ' small Island ' in MISC ) lies in the state of LOC , LOC .

The huge bell which adorns the ORG in LOC was originally donated by the master of a sinking ship who promised to donate the bell to the first church village if he survived his fate. That island was a LOC. He kept his promise and donated the bell to the church of LOC, which is located on a high hillock. Every time the bell was struck, it shattered the windows of the church and the houses in the vicinity, so a deal was struck and the bell was exchanged with the org.","The state of LOC is referred to as the Divar-derived small Island in MISC. It is 10 km from the LOC and is reachable by ferry. The Island is connected to the LOC on the south-east side, LOC on the south-west side, and LOC on the north side by ferry. The city of LOC is connected by a launch from the village of LOC. The train station is the nearest stop to the village because the LOC passes through. The drive to the village is scenic, with paddy fields and wooded hills lacing the roadway, very typical of the MISC countryside The paddy fields have become overrun with weeds in the last few months. The ancient temples of PER, PER and PER were located at the LOC and were part of the MISC pilgrimage. In the 16th century, MISC zealots destroyed these in their drive for Christianisation of LOC. The old pilgrimage spot in MISC is called ORG. The original temple of PER was built in the 12th century by the kings of PER dynasty. The PER was the patron of Deity. It was destroyed by the sultan of the LOC in the middle of the 14th century and reconstructed at the same locality at the close of the same century. It was destroyed again by the MISC in 1540 After the temple was destroyed by the MISC, the PER idol was moved to LOC. The Great MISC leader rebuilt the temple. The religious importance of "" LOC"" was documented by a MISC priest in his book. On account of a temple of many indulgences and pilgrimages, LOC was as much venerated by the MISC as the Holy land. The linga of the temple was made of five metals and was later relocated in the LOC. A prayer and catechism house was built on the foundations of the temple in 1563 and was later turned into the chapel of PER. The original inhabitants of this island were people who used to live in LOC but had to desert due to a disastrous pest that reduced the population. A small village is spread at the bottom of a forested hillock and there is a org. The MISC villas are well maintained. Superb panoramic views of the surrounding countryside can be seen from the top of the hill, as well as the capital of LOC and the bridges across it. The famous MISC is celebrated in LOC on the fourth Saturday of August during the monsoon with great fanfare and attended by thousands of tourists and locals The festival is a memoir about the dispute and the fury of the Villagers over the MISC system of resolving the disputes. The villagers on the LOC fight over ownership of their lands. Put up flags at the boundaries. The villagers didn't like it. They threw stones at the flags to protest. There is a carnival atmosphere created on this day. There is a float in each section of the parade. There was music in the village. The colorfully dressed youngsters are in the picture. The huge bell which adorns the ORG in LOC was originally donated by the master of a sinking ship who promised to donate the bell to the first church village. The island was LOC. He donated the bell to the church of LOC, which is located on a high hill. Every time the bell was struck, it shattered the windows of the church and the houses in the vicinity, so a deal was struck and the bell was exchanged with that of the ORG."
124,"Dorothea von Schlegel ( née Brende Mendelssohn ) ( October 24 1764 - August 3 1839 ) was a German novelist and translator . Dorothea von Schlegel was born in 1764 in Berlin [1 ] . Oldest daughter of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn , a leading figure in the German Enlightenment ( Aufklarung ) . She married the merchant and banker Simon Veit in 1783 . Their son , Philipp Veit , would later become part of a circle of German Christian painters called "" the Nazarenes , "" who influenced the later English painters in the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood . She met the poet and critic Friedrich von Schlegel in the salon of her friend Henriette Herz , after which she left her husband . They were divorced in 1799 . She obtained custody of her younger son , Phillip , and lived with him at the Ziegelstraße , which became a salon frequented by Tieck , Schelling , the Schlegel brothers , and Novalis . Schlegel 's novel "" Lucinde "" ( 1799 ) was seen as an account of their affair , causing a scandal in German literary circles . In 1801 her novel "" Florentin "" was published anonymously by Schlegel . They lived in Paris from 1802 until 1804 , and after her divorce they married as Protestants . In 1807lt she translated "" Corinne "" by Madame de Staë from the French . In 1808 , Friedrich and Dorothea converted to Catholicism . ( She may have adopted the name "" Dorothea "" from a 17th century Dorothea von Schlegel who composed Catholic hymns ) . They continued to visit the salons of Rahel Levin and Henriette Herz , as well as the constellation which surrounded Madame de Staë . Friedrich died in 1829 , after which she moved to Frankfurt am Main . There , she lived with her son Philipp ( also a convert to a medieval style of Catholicism ) until her death in 1839 . Since she was the daughter of the greatest Jewish philosopher of the Enlightenment - Moses Mendelssohn - ( of equal stature with Immanuel Kant , and translator of John Locke and Alexander Pope , as well as Hebrew scriptures into German ) , Dorothea was surrounded throughout her life by the leading poets , critics , musicians , novelists , and philosophers of Europe . Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was her father 's closest friend and colleague , and the Emancipation and secularization of the Jews and Jewish culture was a direct outcome of their work . ( Mendelssohn was the model for Nathan der Weise in Lessing 's play of the same name . ) Friedrich the Great was Lessing 's patron , and he extended royal protection and sponsorship to Mendelssohn , as well . Dorothea 's brother , Joseph , was a friend and sponsor of Alexander von Humboldt , the great naturalist and ethnologist . Her nephew was Felix Mendelssohn , the composer , who with his sister , Fanny , were considered nearly the equals of the Mozarts as child prodigies . To fully appreciate the importance of this cultural scene , see the entries for Moses Mendelssohn , Gotthold Ephraim Lessing , Friedrich Schlegel , Germaine de Staë , Felix Mendelssohn , Ludwi Tieck , Novalis , and others . Dorothea was the common link or nexus among them all . Most of her work , letters , biographies , etc. seem to be available only in German . And there , with the legacy of the Holocaust , she would seem to have an ambiguous status . The emancipation of European Jewry , in which she and her family played the greatest imaginable role , became the main target of the Third Reich and its Nuremberg Laws . For some Jews , she may be a less than admirable figure as well , having left her Jewish husband , violated her divorce settlement , and converted first to Protestantism ( which was favorable towards Judaism ) , and finally to Catholicism ( which was not ) . Most of her later friends were Christians , assimilated or intermarried Jews ( like Rahel Levin ) , or secular Deists and materialists . Her association with Germaine de Staë was obviously of the greatest importance , since she was also the patron and literary companion of Dorothea 's second husband , Friedrich Schlegel . De Staë was the daughter of Jacques Necker , Louis XVI 's finance minister , and a leading figure in the collapse of the Bourbons and the French Revolution . ( See Christopher Herrold 's "" Mistress to an Age . "" ) It was probably through de Staë 's husband , a Swedish Count , that the Schlegel 's were granted a title of nobility in the Swedish court . [ 1 ] In older literature and on her gravestone one finds the date 1763 , but this is the birthyear of her older sister Sara ( May 23rd 1763-April 15 1764 ) whose untimely death was one of the reasons Moses Mendelssohn wrote the Phaedon .

126,"Duane Bobick ( born 24 August , 1950 in Little Falls , Minnesota ) was a boxer from the United States , who became world amateur heavyweight champion in 1971 , and also won the gold medal at the 1971 Pan American Games . He fought for the United States at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich , West Germany , and later contended for the world heavyweight belt during the division 's most highly rated era . Bobick 's younger brother Rodney Bobick was also a heavyweight boxer , though less successful , and died in a single car crash in 1977 . Six foot , three inches tall and 215 pounds in his prime , Bobick was part of a boxing family and grew up with the sport in the 1960s . A tremendous puncher who developed well early by virtue of countless hours in the gym and ring , Bobick had an outstanding amateur career that included a win over Cuba 's famous Teófil Stevenson at the 197 Pan American Games . Bobick added another future champion to his list when he beat Larry Holmes to be named to the 1972 U.S. Olympic boxing team for the Munich Olympics . Bobick was rated a star at this early stage , and may have been very overconfident as he met Stevenson again during the Olympic trials . Despite Bobick winning the second round , Stevenson knocked Bobick down in the third and the contest was stopped . Bobick trained hard to start his pro career , which did not begin until the following spring , 1973 . Bobick trained with and was managed by heavyweight legend Joe Frazier . Bobick 's first match was against Tommy Burns . He sent Burns to the canvas four times on his way to a first-round KO . Bobick had 14 other fights in 1973 , winning them all by KO , including a win over former contender Manuel Ramos . Bobick won his first 19 fights by knockout . He had 10 more fights in 1974 , winning them all again , eight by KO . Knockout wins that year included Ted Gullick and future champion Mike Weaver . He also decisioned veteran boxer Billy Daniels . Bobick was now 25-0 with 23 KOs . He was then rated by many to be the sport 's new "" White Hope , "" taking that label from then-declining Jerry Quarry . Frazier himself was approaching retirement and focusing on upcoming paydays with protege Bobick . Bobick gained top-10 ranking in 1975 with eight more fights and wins , all again by KO . He was now being dodged by some , but a win over Randy Neumann proved he could not be ignored . He had a tentative contract with Muhammed Ali in 1976 , but the fight never materialized . Instead he met and defeated Larry Middleton , fellow Minnesotan Scott LeDoux , Bunny Johnson and Chuck Wepner among his five 1976 fights , all wins with two KOs . Bobick had now improved enough as a boxer to be a legitimate title threat . He took a 38-0 record with 34 KO 's into the ring against powerful former champion Ken Norton in May 1977 . The two punchers went right after each other . Norton connected first and very hard . Following up on the staggered Bobick , Norton also landed a hard punch to Bobick 's windpipe but was never penalized . The fight lasted just one minute before Bobick was counted out . Bobick was widely criticized after the Norton match and dismissed by many . Saturday Night Live made fun of Bobick by showing footage of his Nationally televised knockout loss , over and over again . Despite that , he was back in the ring two months later , winning a rematch with Scott LeDoux . He finished the year 1977 40-1 with 36 KO's . In 1978 , he was upset by South African puncher Kallie Knoetze for his second KO loss . He fought eight more times against second-tier fighters in 1978 , winning all by KO . He was looking to return to top-level contention in 1979 when he was KO 'd by future beltholder John Tate . Another KO loss to George Chaplin that year led to an announcement of retirement . His pro record was 48-4 with 42 KOs with wins over several notable contenders . All four of his pro losses were by KO . Bobick returned to Minnesota and took heavy industry work before a machine accident nearly killed him in 1997 . After that he went into coaching and public speaking , using his still-present celebrity to encourage and help others . In November 2006 , Bobick was elected as a city councilman for the City of Little Falls , Minnesota . Bobick also tried his hand at acting as , naturally , a boxer in Billy boy in 1979 . His brother Rodney also was a professional boxer with a 37-7 record .",I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O I-MISC I-MISC O I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O I-PER I-PER O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O I-LOC I-MISC O O O O I-LOC I-MISC O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O I-MISC O O O I-PER O O O O O I-PER O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-MISC I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O I-PER O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O I-PER O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O,"PER PER ( born 24 August , 1950 in LOC LOC , LOC ) was a boxer from the LOC LOC , who became world amateur heavyweight champion in 1971 , and also won the gold medal at the 1971 MISC MISC MISC .

130,"Eduard Hitzig ( February 6 , 1839 - August 20 , 1907 ) was a German neuropsychiatrist from Berlin . He studied medicine in Berlin and Würzburg . He had as instructors , famous men such as Emil Du Bois-Reymond ( 1818-1896 ) , Rudolf Virchow ( 1821-1902 ) , Moritz Heinrich Romberg ( 1795-1873 ) and Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal ( 1833-1890 ) . He received his doctorate in 1862 , and subsequently practiced medicine in Berlin and Würzburg . In 1875 he became director of the Burghölzli asylum , as well as professor of psychiatry at the University of Zurich . In 1885 Hitzig became a professor at the University of Halle , where he remained until his retirement in 1903 . Hitzig is remembered for his work concerning the interaction between electrical current and the brain . In 1870 , Hitzig assisted by anatomist Gustav Fritsch ( 1837-1927 ) , applied electricity via a thin probe to the exposed cerebral cortex of a dog without anesthesia . They performed these studies at the home of Fritsch because the University of Berlin would not allow such experimentation in their laboratories . What Hitzig and Fritsch had discovered is that electrical stimulation of different areas of the cerebrum caused involuntary muscular contractions of specific parts of the dog 's body . They identified the brains ' "" motor strip "" which is a vertical strip of brain tissue on the cerebrum in the back of the frontal lobe which controls different muscles in the body . In 1870 Hitzig published his findings in an essay called "" On the Electrical Excitability of the Cerebrum "" . This experimentation was considered the first time anyone had done any "" localized study "" regarding the brain and electrical current . However this was not the first time Hitzig had experienced the interaction between the brain and electricity ; earlier in his career as a physician working with the Prussian Army he experimented on wounded soldiers whose skulls were fractured by bullets . Hitzig noticed that applying a small electrical current to the brains of these soldiers caused involuntary muscular movement . Apparently Hitzig 's crude experimentation was inspired by work of 18th century physicist Luigi Galvani who noticed this same electrical phenomena on the brains of frogs . Hitzig and Fritsch 's work opened the door to further "" localized testing "" of the brain by many others including Scottish neurologist , David Ferrier .

The film is based on the novel by Nick Barkow , co-written and directed by Rolf Schübel and tells a fictional story about the creation of the infamous song Gloomy Sunday . Starring are Joachim Król ( László , Jewish restaurant owner ) , Erika Marozsán ( Ilona , waitress and László 's lover ) , Stefano Dionisi ( András , pianist who creates Gloomy Sunday ) and Ben Becker ( Hans Wieck , a German business man who becomes an SS officer ) . In the late 1930s in Budapest the restaurant owner László hires the pianist András to play in his restaurant . András falls in love with László 's lover and beautiful waitress Ilona who inspires András to write his only composition . The resulting song Gloomy Sunday ( German translation : Trauriger Sonntag ) is at first loved and then feared by the public , for its melancholic melody triggers off a chain of suicides . For a while Ilona lives in harmony with both men . The German businessman Hans is a regular patron at the restaurant ; equally , he falls in love with Ilona but she rejects him . He tries to commit suicide by jumping into a river , but László saves him and Hans returns to Germany . After a few years Nazi Germany captures Budapest and Hans returns .
