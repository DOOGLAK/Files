Colonel O
Cornelio I-PER

Both O

orders O

amongst O
the O

provided O
the O

Knowing O
that O
the O
realist O
army O
did O
not O
have O
enough O

, O
Belgrano I-PER
planned O
to O
use O
a O

, O
confidently O
believing O
that O
Pezuela I-PER

not O
provide O

. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1813 O
, O
most O
of O
Belgrano I-PER

The O

at O
Condo-Condo I-LOC
under O
the O
orders O
of O

Major O
Saturnino I-PER

which O
allowed O

and O
any O

between O

Castro I-PER
also O
attained O
documents O
from O

giving O

to O
Belgrano I-PER

With O
these O
documents O
Pazuela I-PER
was O
able O
to O
interrupt O
Belgrano I-PER

and O
began O
his O

on O
the O

on O

the O

forced O

, O
his O

The O
