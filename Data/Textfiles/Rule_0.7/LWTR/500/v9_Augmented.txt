However O
, O

this O

very O

minor O
political O
organisation O
in O

by O
Eric I-PER

with O
its O
basis O
in O
the O
economic O
theory O
of O
Social O
Credit O
expounded O
by O
C. I-PER
H. I-PER
Douglas I-PER
. O

It O
describes O
itself O
as O
upholding O
the O
virtues O
of O
freedom O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
political O
party O
, O
but O
rather O
sees O
itself O
as O
a O
watchdog O
against O
government O

. O

The O
League I-ORG
was O
formed O
in O
1960 O
by O
a O
merger O
of O
various O
Leagues O
of O
Rights O
based O
in O
the O
Australian I-MISC
states O
, O
the O
first O
of O
which O
was O
based O
in O

from O

The O
League I-ORG
, O
like O
many O
other O
far-Right O
organisations O
, O
strongly O
denies O
that O
the O
Holocaust I-MISC
, O
during O
which O
millions O
of O
people O
, O
particularly O
European I-MISC
Jews I-MISC
, O
were O

occurred O

It O
is O
strongly O
supportive O
of O
the O
polemicist O
and O
Holocaust I-MISC
denial O
advocate O
David I-PER
Irving I-PER
. O

They O
believe O
that O
the O
world O
is O
run O
by O
a O
secret O
society O
of O
Jews I-MISC
. O

The O
League I-ORG
is O
distinctive O
for O
asserting O
that O
The I-MISC
Protocols I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Elders I-MISC
of I-MISC
Zion I-MISC
is O
a O
genuine O
Jewish I-MISC
document O

the O
Encyclopædi I-MISC

describes O
the O
Protocols I-MISC
as O
a O
" O
fraudulent O
document O
that O
served O
as O
a O
pretext O
and O
rationale O
for O
anti-Semitism O
in O
the O
early O
20th O
century O
" O
) O
. O

The O
League I-ORG
describes O
itself O
as O
being O
based O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
Christianity I-MISC
and O
is O
vehement O
in O
its O
anti-communism O
. O

They O
argue O
in O
favour O
of O
capitalism O
by O
promoting O
the O
sanctity O
of O
private O
property O
and O
individual O
enterprise O
. O

They O
are O
keen O
promoters O
of O
Social O
Credit O
. O

They O
are O
strongly O
monarchist O
and O
completely O
opposed O
to O
Australian I-MISC
republicanism O

see O
the O
