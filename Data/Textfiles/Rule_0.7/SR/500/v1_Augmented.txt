CBS I-ORG

an O
early O

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
a O
personal O
project O
of O
CBS I-ORG
founder O
William I-PER
Paley I-PER
, O
who O
hoped O
it O
would O
blaze O
a O
trail O
for O
cultural O
programming O
in O
the O
then-emerging O
cable O
television O
medium O
. O

Its O
program O
offerings O
were O
ambitious O
and O
often O
critically O
praised O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O
, O
and O
ultimately O
failed O
, O
largely O
because O
of O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O
cable O
systems O
across O
the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
to O
give O
it O
carriage O
, O
limiting O
severely O
its O
ability O
to O
attract O
both O
viewers O
and O
advertisers O
for O
its O
costly O
lineup O
of O
programming O
. O

Cable O
systems O
in O
the O
early O
1980s O
had O
far O
more O
limited O
channel O
capacity O
than O
they O
do O
today O
( O
usually O
only O
a O
few O
dozen O
channels O
in O
most O
cities O
) O
. O

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
competing O
for O
channel O
space O
by O
appealing O
to O
a O
select O
and O
relatively O
small O
upscale O
audience O
, O
while O
other O
networks O
coming O
on O
line O
at O
the O
same O
time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewership O
and O
therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O
. O

MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
thrived O
and O
gave O
rise O
to O
additional O
companion O
channels O
within O
a O
short O
time O
, O
while O
the O
CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
channel O
folded O
after O
just O
over O
14 O
months O

The O
Ayalon I-LOC
Cave I-LOC
is O
a O
large O
underground O
limestone O
cave O
located O
near O
Ramla I-LOC
, O
Israel I-LOC

The O
cave O
, O
300 O
feet O
deep O
, O
with O
its O
branch O
extends O
almost O
2.5 O
kilometres O
making O
it O
the O
second O

Researchers O
announced O
that O
they O
have O
so O
far O
discovered O
eight O
new O
species O
, O
all O
without O
eyes O
, O
including O
four O
crustacean O
species O
and O
four O
terrestrial O
species O
, O
previously O
unknown O
to O
science O
. O

They O
added O
that O
the O
crustaceans O
included O
two O
saltwater O
species O
and O
two O
freshwater O
species O
, O
indicating O
that O
this O
diversity O
might O
help O
better O
understand O
the O
water O
history O
of O
the O
region O
. O

The O
cave O
was O
first O
discovered O
when O
a O
small O
opening O
was O
discerned O
in O
a O
quarry O
near O
Ramla I-LOC
. O

According O
to O
Professor O
Amos I-PER
Frumkin I-PER
of O
the O
Hebrew I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
the O
cave O
is O
unique O
in O
that O
a O
thick O
layer O
of O
chalk O
left O
it O
impermeable O
to O
water O
. O

The O
cave O
will O
remain O
closed O
to O
the O
public O
to O
allow O
scientific O
investigation O
to O
continue O
undisturbed O
. O

As O
the O
cave O
was O
completely O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
environment O
, O
it O
sustained O
an O
independent O
ecosystem O
; O
this O
ecosystem O
did O
not O
rely O
on O
sunlight O
and O
photosynthesis O
, O
or O
on O
organic O
compounds O
, O
for O
an O
energy O
source O
. O

Rather O
, O
energy O
was O
extracted O
by O
Chemoautotrophic O
bacteria O
, O
living O
in O
a O
film O
on O
top O
of O
the O
pool O
water O
. O

These O
bacteria O
produce O
energy O
by O
oxidizing O
the O
sulfide O
compounds O
in O
the O
water O
, O
and O
derive O
organic O
compounds O
using O
carbon O

of O
a O
goose O
or O
duck O
( O
whence O
they O
were O
sometimes O
called O
Canards I-MISC
) O
. O

And O
so O
pestilential O
was O
their O
touch O
considered O
that O
it O
was O
a O
crime O
for O
them O
to O
walk O
the O
common O
road O
barefooted O
. O

The O
only O
trades O
allowed O
them O
were O
those O
of O
butcher O
and O
carpenter O
, O
and O
their O
ordinary O
occupation O
was O
wood-cutting O
. O

The O
origin O
of O
Agotes I-MISC
( O
or O
Cagots I-MISC
) O
is O
uncertain O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
they O
were O
descendants O
of O
the O
Visigoths I-MISC
, O
and O
somebody O
derives O
the O
name O
from O
caas O
( O
dog O
) O
and O
Goth I-MISC
. O

But O
opposed O
to O
this O
etymology O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
word O
" O
cagot O
" O
is O
first O
found O
in O
this O
form O
no O
earlier O
than O
1551 O

French I-MISC
historian O
Pierre I-PER
de I-PER
Marca I-PER
( O
16th O
century O
) O
, O
in O
his O
Histoire I-MISC
de I-MISC
Beam I-MISC
, O
holds O
that O
the O
word O
signifies O
hunters O
of O
the O
Goths I-MISC
, O
and O
that O
the O
Cagots I-MISC
are O
descendants O
of O
the O
Saracens I-MISC
. O

Others O
made O
them O
descendants O
of O
the O
Albigenses I-MISC
. O

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians I-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O
lepers O
were O
known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O
, O
and O
that O
, O
Goths I-MISC
or O
not O
, O
these O
Cagots I-MISC
were O
affected O
in O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
with O
a O
particular O
form O
of O
leprosy O
or O
a O
condition O
resembling O
it O
. O

Thus O
would O
arise O
the O
confusion O
between O
Christians I-MISC
and O
Cretins I-MISC
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
the O
French I-MISC
Revolution I-MISC
that O
any O
steps O
were O
taken O
to O
ameliorate O
their O
lot O
, O
but O
today O
they O
no O
longer O
form O
a O
class O
and O
have O
been O
practically O
lost O
sight O
of O
in O
the O
general O
peasantry O
