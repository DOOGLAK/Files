Colonel O
Cornelio I-PER

Both O

orders O
to O
incite O
rebellion O
amongst O
the O

who O
provided O
the O

that O
the O
realist O
army O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
mules O
to O

, O
Belgrano I-PER
planned O
to O
use O
a O
pincer O
movement O
to O
attack O
, O
confidently O
believing O
that O
Pezuela I-PER

not O
provide O
much O

. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1813 O

Major O
Saturnino I-PER

and O
any O

Castro I-PER
also O
attained O
documents O
from O

giving O
instructions O
to O
Belgrano I-PER

With O
these O
documents O
Pazuela I-PER
was O
able O
to O
interrupt O
Belgrano I-PER

began O
his O

on O
the O

the O

of O
the O

forced O

, O
his O

remained O
in O

and O
defeated O
Belgrano I-PER

. O

The O

reorganized O
itself O
and O
appropriated O
all O
of O
its O

, O
continuously O
shelling O
the O
few O

left O
in O
Belgrano I-PER

Belgrano I-PER

Eustaquio I-PER

decided O
that O
