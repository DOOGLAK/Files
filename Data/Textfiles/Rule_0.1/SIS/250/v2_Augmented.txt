Its O

often O
critically O
praised O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O

ultimately O
failed O

largely O
because O
of O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O

give O
it O

competing O

while O
other O

coming O
on O

at O
the O
same O
time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewership O

therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O

MTV I-ORG

thrived O

gave O
rise O

additional O

Nevertheless O
the O

the O

time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG

promised O
larger O

more O
broad-based O

therefore O
got O
cable O

far O
more O
easily O

MTV I-ORG

thrived O

the O
