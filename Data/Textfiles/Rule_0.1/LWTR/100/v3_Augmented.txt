Fearing O
a O

convened O

At O
the O
hearing O
, O
family O

including O
Carder I-PER

opposed O

the O
grounds O
that O

that O

opposed O
the O

However O
, O
a O

personally O
familiar O

status O
testified O
that O
the O

would O
have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O
of O
survival O
-- O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O

Carder I-PER

own O
long-term O
oncologist O

since O

for O
