often O

Nevertheless O
the O

struggled O

largely O
because O

the O
reluctance O

many O

other O

coming O

at O
the O

time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG

ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O

more O
broad-based O
viewership O

therefore O
got O
cable O

to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O

MTV I-ORG
