CBS I-ORG

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
a O
personal O
project O
of O
CBS I-ORG
founder O
William I-PER
Paley I-PER
, O
who O
hoped O
it O
would O
blaze O
a O
trail O
for O
cultural O
programming O
in O
the O
then-emerging O
cable O
television O
medium O
. O

Its O
program O
offerings O
were O
ambitious O
and O
often O
critically O
praised O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O
, O
and O
ultimately O
failed O
, O
largely O
because O
of O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O
cable O
systems O
across O
the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
to O
give O
it O
carriage O
, O
limiting O
severely O
its O
ability O
to O
attract O
both O
viewers O
and O
advertisers O
for O
its O
costly O
lineup O
of O
programming O
. O

Cable O
systems O
in O
the O
early O
1980s O
had O
far O
more O
limited O
channel O
capacity O
than O
they O
do O
today O
( O
usually O
only O
a O
few O
dozen O
channels O
in O
most O
cities O
) O
. O

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
competing O
for O
channel O
space O
by O
appealing O
to O
a O
select O
and O
relatively O
small O
upscale O
audience O
, O
while O
other O
networks O
coming O
on O
line O
at O
the O
same O
time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewership O
and O
therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O
. O

MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
thrived O
and O
gave O
rise O
to O
additional O
companion O
channels O
within O
a O
short O
time O
, O
while O
the O
CBS I-ORG

channel O
folded O
after O

14 O

is O

In O
1870 O
Hitzig I-PER
published O
his O
findings O
in O
an O
essay O
called O
" O
On I-MISC
the I-MISC
Electrical I-MISC
Excitability I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Cerebrum I-MISC
" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O
brain O
and O
electrical O
current O
. O

However O
this O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Hitzig I-PER
had O
experienced O
the O
interaction O
between O
the O
brain O
and O
electricity O
; O
earlier O
in O
his O
career O
as O
a O
physician O
working O
with O
the O
Prussian I-ORG
Army I-ORG
he O
experimented O
on O
wounded O
soldiers O
whose O
skulls O
were O
fractured O
by O
bullets O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
electrical O
current O
to O
the O
brains O
of O
these O
soldiers O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
movement O
. O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER
's O
crude O
experimentation O
was O
inspired O
by O
work O
of O
18th O
century O
physicist O
Luigi I-PER
Galvani I-PER
who O
noticed O
this O

electrical O
phenomena O
on O
the O
brains O
of O

Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER

work O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
further O
" O

of O

such O

What O
Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
had O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O
of O
different O
areas O
of O
the O
cerebrum O
caused O
involuntary O
of O
proposed O

They O

which O
is O
a O

of O
the O

controls O

In O
1870 O
Hitzig I-PER
published O
his O
findings O
in O
which O
essay O
called O
" O
Australian I-MISC
the I-MISC
Electrical I-MISC
Excitability I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Cerebrum I-MISC
" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O
brain O
and O
electrical O
current O
. O

However O
this O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Hitzig I-PER
had O
experienced O
the O
interaction O
between O

; O
earlier O
in O
his O
career O
as O
a O
physician O
working O
network O
the O
Prussian I-ORG

he O
experimented O
on O
wounded O
soldiers O
whose O
skulls O
were O
fractured O

. O

Hitzig I-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
its O
current O
to O
the O
brains O
of O
these O
soldiers O
caused O
involuntary O
instructors O
movement O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER

crude O
experimentation O
was O
inspired O
by O
work O
of O
