. O

Since O
then O
it O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O
capture O
of O
large O
and O
medium-sized O
animals O
to O
transport O
them O
safely O
. O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
barbiturate O
and O
/ O
or O
other O
drugs O
, O
backed O
by O
a O
ball O
bearing O
which O
was O
separated O
from O
the O
drug O
mix O
with O
a O
wadding O
. O

On O
impact O
with O
the O
animal O
the O
inertial O
momentum O
of O
the O
balls O
injects O
the O
drug O
into O
the O
animal O
, O
causing O
torpor O
and O
prostration O
within O
minutes O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O
drugs O
the O
handlers O
then O
have O
to O
move O
quickly O
to O
secure O
the O
animal O
for O
transport O
, O
monitor O
its O
vital O
signs O
, O
protect O
its O
eyes O
and O
ears O
, O
and O
then O
inject O
reversing O
drugs O
when O
needed O
. O

Many O
large O
animals O
are O
acutely O
sensitive O
to O
stress O
and O
can O
easily O
die O
without O
careful O
treatment O
. O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O
Dr O
Harthoorn I-PER
's O
team O
was O
that O
different O
species O
, O
despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O
example O
the O
rhinoceros O
and O
the O
buffalo O
) O
needed O
very O
different O
doses O
and O
spectra O
of O
drugs O
to O
safely O
immobilise O
them O
. O

In O
some O
species O
the O
margin O
of O
error O
is O
very O
small O
indeed O
. O

Modern O
capture O
guns O
are O
gas-fired O
and O
collapsible O
. O

Several O
models O
are O
available O

an O

age O
thirteen O

her O
doctors O
fought O
with O
equal O
determination O

The O

Angela I-PER
later O
married O

twenty-five O
weeks O
pregnant O
, O
her O
cancer O
was O
discovered O
to O

recurred O

metastasized O
to O
her O
lung O

Exactly O
what O
plan O
she O
made O
on O

this O
is O
unclear O

one O

that O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
prolong O
her O
life O

and O
elected O
to O
start O
radiation O

chemotherapy O
, O
regardless O

the O

others O
state O
that O
she O
chose O
to O
institute O
only O
palliative O
care O
, O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
remain O
alive O
until O
the O
28th O
week O
of O

it O
was O

chance O

her O

, O

-- O
who O
were O
also O
the O
liability O

were O
disturbed O
to O
hear O
that O
she O
had O
not O
elected O
to O
have O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
procedure O
. O

Fearing O
a O
lawsuit O
by O
pro-life O
activists O
, O
they O
convened O
a O
court O
hearing O
at O
the O
hospital O
and O
obtained O
separate O
counsels O
for O
Carder I-PER
, O
her O
fetus O
, O
and O
the O
hospital O
. O

At O
the O
hearing O
, O
family O
members O
, O
including O
Carder I-PER
's O
husband O
, O
opposed O
the O
C-section O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
she O
would O
be O
unlikely O
to O
survive O
it O
and O
that O
she O
would O
not O
want O
it O
( O
Carder I-PER
herself O
, O
now O
gravely O
ill O
, O
did O
not O
testify O
) O
. O

Her O
treating O
physicians O
also O
opposed O
the O
procedure O
. O

However O
, O
a O
neonatologist O
not O
personally O
familiar O
with O
her O
medical O
status O
testified O
that O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O
of O
survival O
-- O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O
healthy O
woman O
's O
fetus O
at O
the O
same O
gestational O
age O
. O

Carder I-PER
's O
own O
long-term O
oncologist O
was O
not O
contacted O
; O
he O
has O
since O
stated O
that O
he O
would O
have O
called O
the O
procedure O
" O
medically O
inadvisable O
both O
for O
Angela I-PER
Carder I-PER
and O
for O
the O
fetus O
" O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
and O
despite O
medical O
testimony O
that O
such O
a O
procedure O
would O
probably O
end O
Carder I-PER

life O
, O
an O
order O
was O
issued O
authorizing O
the O
hospital O
to O
perform O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
. O

Obstetricians O
at O
the O
hospital O
initially O
refused O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
procedure O
, O
but O
eventually O
one O
reluctantly O
agreed O
. O

A O
three-judge O
appellate O
panel O
upheld O
the O
decision O
in O
an O
emergency O
telephone O
appeal O
, O
despite O
Carder I-PER

own O
repeated O
pleas O
of O
" O
I O
do O

want O
it O
done O
. O

" O
Exactly O
how O
long O
the O
fetus O
survived O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
some O
dispute O
. O

The O
most O
commonly O
cited O
figure O
is O
two O
hours O

Susan I-PER
Faludi I-PER
quotes O
the O
obstetrician O
who O
performed O
the O
surgery O
as O
saying O
attempts O
to O
inflate O
the O
fetus O

lungs O
were O
" O
like O

having O
to O
command O
a O
company O
of O
new O
conscripts O
with O
insufficient O
artillery O
, O
Belgrano I-PER
accepted O
the O
commanding O
post O
. O

Belgrano I-PER
's O
army O
was O
supported O
by O
Colonel O
Baltasar I-PER
Cárdenas I-PER
and O
the O
2,000 O
poorly O
organized O
natives O
under O
his O
command O
, O
and O
Colonel O
Cornelio I-PER
Zelaya I-PER
with O
forces O
from O
Cochabamba I-LOC
. O

Both O
colonels O
had O
orders O
to O
incite O
rebellion O
amongst O
the O
indigenous O
populations O
who O
provided O
the O
realists O
with O
valuable O
information O
. O

Knowing O
that O
the O
realist O
army O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
mules O
to O
move O
its O
artillery O
and O
provisions O
, O
Belgrano I-PER
planned O
to O
use O
a O
pincer O
movement O
to O
attack O
, O
confidently O
believing O
that O
Pezuela I-PER
would O
not O
provide O
much O
resistance O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1813 O
, O
most O
of O
Belgrano I-PER
's O
army O
arrived O
in O
the O
prairie O
of O
Vilcapugio I-LOC
, O
which O
was O
a O
plateau O
surrounded O
by O
tall O
mountains O
to O
the O
north O
of O
Potosí I-LOC
. O

The O
realist O
troops O
were O
encamped O
at O
Condo-Condo I-LOC
under O
the O
orders O
of O
Pazuela I-PER
and O
Major O
Saturnino I-PER
Castro I-PER
, O
which O
allowed O
them O
to O
cut O
off O
Cárdenas I-PER
' O
troops O
and O
any O
communication O
between O
Belgrano I-PER
and O
the O
Cochabamban I-MISC
forces O
. O

Castro I-PER
also O
attained O
documents O
from O
Cárdenas I-PER
giving O
instructions O
to O
Belgrano I-PER
. O

With O
these O
documents O
Pazuela I-PER
was O
able O
to O
interrupt O
Belgrano I-PER
's O
plans O
and O
began O
his O
advance O
on O
the O
mountains O
on O
October O
1 O
. O

Belgrano I-PER
's O
army O
veterans O
from O
the O
North O
contained O
the O
left O
flank O
and O
center O
column O
of O
the O
realist O
army O
and O
forced O
them O
to O
back O
down O
until O
Pezuela I-PER
recognized O
he O
was O
losing O
the O
battle O
at O
Virrey I-LOC
de I-LOC
Lima I-LOC
; O
however O
, O
his O
own O
left O
flank O
remained O
in O
action O
and O
defeated O
Belgrano I-PER
's O
right O
column O
. O

The O
realist O
army O
reorganized O
itself O
and O
appropriated O
all O
of O
its O
artillery O
, O
continuously O
shelling O
the O
few O
soldiers O
left O
in O
Belgrano I-PER
's O
encampment O
. O

Belgrano I-PER
and O
Eustaquio I-PER
Díaz I-PER
Vélez I-PER
had O
decided O
that O
Vel I-PER
would O
be O
the O
one O
to O
go O
to O
Potosí I-LOC
to O
reunite O
with O
the O

Díaz I-PER

the O

the O
