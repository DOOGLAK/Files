not O

enough O

confidently O
believing O

At O
the O

most O

of O
the O

that O

the O
Saracens I-MISC

Others O
made O
them O
descendants O

the O
Albigenses I-MISC

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians I-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O
lepers O
were O
known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O
, O
and O
that O
, O
Goths I-MISC
or O
not O
, O
these O
Cagots I-MISC
were O
affected O
in O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
with O
a O
particular O
form O
of O
leprosy O
or O
a O
condition O
resembling O
it O
. O

Thus O
would O
arise O
the O
confusion O
between O
Christians I-MISC
and O
Cretins I-MISC
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
the O
French I-MISC
Revolution I-MISC
that O
any O
steps O
were O
taken O
to O
ameliorate O
their O
lot O

but O
today O
they O
no O
longer O
form O
a O

lost O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
barbiturate O

other O

On O
impact O
with O
the O
animal O
the O
inertial O
momentum O
of O
the O
balls O
injects O
the O
drug O
into O
the O
animal O
, O
causing O
torpor O

prostration O
within O
minutes O

Because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O

the O
handlers O
then O
have O
to O
move O
quickly O
to O
secure O
the O

Many O
large O
animals O
are O
acutely O
sensitive O
to O
stress O

can O
easily O
die O
without O

treatment O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O
Dr O
Harthoorn I-PER

team O
was O
that O
different O
species O
, O
despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O
example O
the O
rhinoceros O
and O
the O
buffalo O
) O
needed O
very O
different O
doses O
and O
spectra O
of O
drugs O
to O
safely O
immobilise O
them O
. O

In O
some O
species O
the O
margin O

error O
is O
very O
small O
indeed O
