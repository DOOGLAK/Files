The O

Cave I-LOC
is O
a O
large O

300 O

with O

almost O
2.5 O

the O

Researchers O
announced O
that O
they O
have O

eight O
new O
species O
, O
all O
without O

, O
including O
four O
crustacean O

and O
four O
terrestrial O
species O
, O
previously O

. O

They O
added O
that O
the O
crustaceans O
included O
two O
saltwater O
species O

two O
freshwater O

, O
indicating O
that O
this O

might O
help O
better O
understand O
the O

history O
of O

The O
cave O
was O
first O
discovered O
when O
a O
small O
opening O
was O
discerned O
in O
a O
quarry O
near O
Ramla I-LOC
. O

According O
to O
Professor O
Amos I-PER
Frumkin I-PER
of O
the O
Hebrew I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
the O
cave O
is O
unique O
in O
that O
a O
thick O
layer O
of O
chalk O
left O
it O
impermeable O
to O
water O
. O

The O
cave O
will O
remain O
closed O
to O
the O
public O
to O
allow O
scientific O
investigation O
to O
continue O
undisturbed O
. O

As O
the O
cave O
was O
completely O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
environment O
, O
it O
sustained O
an O
independent O
ecosystem O
; O
this O
ecosystem O
did O
not O
rely O
on O
sunlight O
and O
photosynthesis O
, O
or O
on O
organic O
compounds O
, O
for O
an O
energy O
source O
. O

Rather O
, O
energy O
was O
extracted O
by O
Chemoautotrophic O
bacteria O
, O
living O
in O
a O
film O
on O
top O
of O
the O
pool O

. O

These O

produce O
energy O
