where O

Hitzig I-PER
is O
remembered O
for O
his O
work O

In O

, O
Hitzig I-PER
assisted O
by O
anatomist O
Gustav I-PER
Fritsch I-PER
( O
1837-1927 O

, O
applied O
electricity O
via O
a O
thin O
probe O
to O
the O

of O
a O

They O
performed O
these O

What O
Hitzig I-PER

Fritsch I-PER
had O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O
of O
different O
areas O
of O
the O
cerebrum O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
contractions O
of O
specific O

In O

Hitzig I-PER

essay O
called O
" O
On I-MISC
the I-MISC
Electrical I-MISC
Excitability I-MISC

" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O

anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O

However O
this O

Hitzig I-PER

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER
