a O

Its O

and O
often O
critically O
praised O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O

ultimately O

largely O
because O
of O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O

other O

coming O

at O
the O

time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG

promised O
larger O

more O
broad-based O
viewership O

therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O

MTV I-ORG
