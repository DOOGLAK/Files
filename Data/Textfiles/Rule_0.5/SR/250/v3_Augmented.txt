Its O

often O
critically O
praised O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O

ultimately O
failed O

largely O
because O

the O
reluctance O

while O
other O
networks O
coming O
on O
line O
at O
the O
same O
time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewership O

therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O

MTV I-ORG

thrived O
