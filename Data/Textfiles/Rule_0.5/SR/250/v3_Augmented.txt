often O

Nevertheless O
the O

struggled O

largely O

the O
reluctance O

other O
networks O
coming O
on O
line O
at O
the O

time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewership O

therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O

MTV I-ORG

thrived O

Both O

realist O
army O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
mules O
to O
move O
its O
artillery O
and O
provisions O
, O
Belgrano I-PER
planned O
to O
use O
a O
pincer O
movement O
to O

confidently O
believing O
that O
Pezuela I-PER
would O
not O
provide O

to O
cut O

any O

between O
Belgrano I-PER

the O

Castro I-PER
also O
attained O
documents O
from O
CÃ¡rdenas I-PER
giving O
instructions O
to O
Belgrano I-PER

With O
these O
documents O
Pazuela I-PER
was O
able O
to O
interrupt O
Belgrano I-PER

began O
his O

from O
the O

contained O
the O

of O
the O
realist O
army O

forced O
them O
to O
back O
down O

Pezuela I-PER
recognized O

was O
losing O
the O

at O
Virrey I-LOC

, O
his O

defeated O
Belgrano I-PER

. O

The O
realist O
army O
reorganized O
itself O
and O
appropriated O
all O
of O
its O

continuously O
shelling O
the O
few O

in O
Belgrano I-PER

Belgrano I-PER

Eustaquio I-PER
DÃ­az I-PER
