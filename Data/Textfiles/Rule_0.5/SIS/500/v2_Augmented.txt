The O

by O

by O
Dr O
Tony I-PER
Pooley I-PER

Dr O

Harthoorn I-PER
in O
Kenya I-LOC
in O
the O
early O

. O

Since O
then O
it O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O
capture O
of O
large O
and O
medium-sized O
animals O
to O
transport O
them O
safely O
. O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
barbiturate O

or O
other O

a O

On O

the O
animal O
the O

the O
balls O
injects O
the O
drug O

the O
animal O

prostration O
within O
minutes O

Because O
of O
the O
power O

the O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O
Dr O

team O
was O
that O
different O

despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O
example O
the O
rhinoceros O

the O

safely O
immobilise O

her O

The O

Angela I-PER

her O
cancer O
was O
discovered O
to O
have O
recurred O

metastasized O
to O
her O
lung O

Exactly O
what O
plan O
she O
made O
on O
learning O
this O
is O
unclear O
: O
one O
source O
claims O
that O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
prolong O
her O
life O
, O
and O
elected O
to O
start O
radiation O
and O
chemotherapy O
, O
regardless O
of O
known O
risks O
to O
the O

others O
state O
that O
she O
chose O
to O
institute O
only O
palliative O
care O
, O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
remain O
alive O
until O
the O
28th O
week O
of O
gestation O
, O
when O
it O
was O
thought O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
a O
better O
chance O
of O
survival O

Whatever O
her O
choice O
, O
the O

-- O
who O
were O
also O
the O
liability O

were O
disturbed O
to O
hear O
that O
she O
had O
not O
elected O
to O
have O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
procedure O
. O

Fearing O
a O
lawsuit O
by O
pro-life O
activists O
, O
they O
convened O
a O
court O
hearing O
at O
the O
hospital O
and O
obtained O
separate O
counsels O
for O
Carder I-PER
, O
her O
fetus O
, O
and O
the O
hospital O
. O

At O
the O
hearing O
, O
family O
members O
, O
including O
Carder I-PER
's O
husband O
, O
opposed O
the O
C-section O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
she O
would O
be O
unlikely O
to O
survive O
it O
and O
that O
she O
would O
not O
want O
it O
( O
Carder I-PER
herself O
, O
now O
gravely O
ill O
, O
did O
not O
testify O
) O
. O

Her O
treating O
physicians O
also O
opposed O
the O
procedure O
. O

However O
, O
a O
neonatologist O
not O
personally O
familiar O
with O
her O
medical O
status O
testified O
that O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O
of O
survival O
-- O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O
healthy O
woman O
's O
fetus O
at O
the O
same O
gestational O
age O
. O

Carder I-PER
's O
own O
long-term O
oncologist O
was O
not O
contacted O
; O
he O
has O
since O
stated O
that O
he O
would O
have O
called O
the O
procedure O
" O
medically O
inadvisable O
both O
for O
Angela I-PER
Carder I-PER
and O
for O
the O
fetus O
" O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
and O
despite O
medical O
testimony O
that O
such O
a O
procedure O
would O
probably O
end O
Carder I-PER
's O
life O
, O
an O
order O
was O
issued O
authorizing O
the O
hospital O
to O
perform O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
. O

Obstetricians O
at O
the O
hospital O
initially O
refused O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
procedure O
, O
but O
eventually O
one O
reluctantly O
agreed O
. O

A O
three-judge O
appellate O
panel O
upheld O
the O
decision O
in O
an O
emergency O
telephone O
appeal O
, O
despite O
Carder I-PER

own O
repeated O
pleas O
of O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
it O
done O
. O

" O
Exactly O
how O
long O
the O
fetus O
survived O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
some O
dispute O
. O

The O
most O
commonly O
cited O
figure O
is O
two O
hours O

Susan I-PER
Faludi I-PER
quotes O
the O
obstetrician O
who O
performed O
the O
surgery O
as O
saying O
attempts O
to O
inflate O
the O

lungs O
were O
" O
