from O
Berlin I-LOC
. O

He O
studied O
medicine O
in O

He O
had O
as O
instructors O
, O
famous O

such O

Emil I-PER
Du I-PER
Bois-Reymond I-PER
( O
1818-1896 O

Karl I-PER
Friedrich I-PER
Otto I-PER
Westphal I-PER
( O

) O
. O

He O

as O
professor O
of O
psychiatry O
at O

. O

In O
1885 O
Hitzig I-PER
became O
a O
professor O
at O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Halle I-ORG
, O
where O
he O
remained O
until O
his O
retirement O
in O
1903 O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
is O
remembered O
for O
his O
work O
concerning O
the O
interaction O
between O
electrical O
current O
and O
the O
brain O
. O

In O
1870 O
, O
Hitzig I-PER
assisted O
by O
anatomist O
Gustav I-PER
Fritsch I-PER
( O
1837-1927 O
) O
, O
applied O
electricity O
via O
a O
thin O
probe O
to O
the O
exposed O
cerebral O
cortex O
of O
a O
dog O
without O
anesthesia O
. O

They O
performed O
these O
studies O
at O
the O
home O
of O
Fritsch I-PER
because O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Berlin I-ORG
would O
not O
allow O
such O
experimentation O
in O
their O
laboratories O
. O

What O
Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
had O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O
of O
different O
areas O
of O
the O
cerebrum O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
contractions O
of O
specific O
parts O
of O
the O
dog O
's O
body O
. O

They O
identified O
the O
brains O
' O
" O
motor O
strip O
" O
which O
is O
a O
vertical O
strip O
of O
brain O
tissue O
on O
the O
cerebrum O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
which O
controls O
different O
muscles O
in O
the O
body O
. O

In O
1870 O
Hitzig I-PER
published O
his O
findings O
in O
an O
essay O
called O
" O
On I-MISC
the I-MISC
Electrical I-MISC
Excitability I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Cerebrum I-MISC
" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O
brain O
and O
electrical O
current O
. O

However O
this O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Hitzig I-PER
had O
experienced O
the O
interaction O
between O
the O
brain O
and O
electricity O
; O
earlier O
in O
his O
career O
as O
a O
physician O
working O
with O
the O
Prussian I-ORG
Army I-ORG
he O
experimented O
on O
wounded O
soldiers O
whose O
skulls O
were O
fractured O
by O
bullets O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
electrical O
current O
to O
the O
brains O
of O
these O
soldiers O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
movement O
. O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER
's O
crude O
experimentation O
was O
inspired O
by O
work O
of O
18th O
century O
physicist O
Luigi I-PER
Galvani I-PER
who O
noticed O
this O
same O
electrical O
phenomena O
on O
the O
brains O
of O
frogs O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
's O
work O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
further O
" O
localized O
testing O
" O
of O
the O
brain O
by O
many O
others O
including O
