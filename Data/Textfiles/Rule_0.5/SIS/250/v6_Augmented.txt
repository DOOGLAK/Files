The O

restarted O
upon O
the O

after O
the O
Army I-ORG

the I-ORG

during O
the O

Despite O
having O
malaria O
and O
having O
to O
command O
a O
company O
of O
new O
conscripts O
with O
insufficient O
artillery O
, O
Belgrano I-PER
accepted O
the O
commanding O
post O
. O

Belgrano I-PER
's O
army O
was O
supported O
by O
Colonel O
Baltasar I-PER
Cárdenas I-PER
and O
the O
2,000 O
poorly O
organized O
natives O
under O
his O
command O
, O
and O
Colonel O
Cornelio I-PER
Zelaya I-PER
with O
forces O
from O
Cochabamba I-LOC

Both O
colonels O
had O
orders O
to O
incite O
rebellion O
amongst O
the O
indigenous O
populations O
who O
provided O
the O
realists O
with O
valuable O
information O

Knowing O
that O
the O
realist O
army O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
mules O
to O
move O
its O
artillery O
and O
provisions O
, O
Belgrano I-PER
planned O
to O
use O
a O
pincer O
movement O
to O
attack O
, O
confidently O
believing O
that O
Pezuela I-PER
would O
not O
provide O
much O
resistance O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1813 O
, O
most O
of O
Belgrano I-PER

army O
arrived O
in O
the O
prairie O
of O
Vilcapugio I-LOC

which O
was O
a O

surrounded O
by O
tall O

The O

encamped O
at O
Condo-Condo I-LOC
under O
the O
orders O
of O
Pazuela I-PER

Major O
Saturnino I-PER
Castro I-PER
, O
which O
allowed O
them O
to O
cut O
off O
Cárdenas I-PER
' O
troops O
and O
any O
communication O
between O
Belgrano I-PER
and O
the O
Cochabamban I-MISC
forces O
. O

Castro I-PER
also O
attained O
documents O
from O
Cárdenas I-PER
giving O
instructions O
to O
Belgrano I-PER
. O

With O
these O
documents O
Pazuela I-PER
was O
able O
to O
interrupt O
Belgrano I-PER
's O
plans O
and O
began O
his O
advance O
on O
the O
mountains O
on O
October O
1 O
. O

Belgrano I-PER
's O
army O
veterans O
from O
the O
North O
contained O
the O
left O
flank O
and O
center O
column O
of O
the O
realist O
army O
and O
forced O
them O
to O
back O
down O
until O
Pezuela I-PER
recognized O
he O
was O
losing O
the O
battle O
at O
Virrey I-LOC
de I-LOC
Lima I-LOC
; O
however O
, O
his O
own O
left O
flank O
remained O
in O
action O
and O
defeated O
Belgrano I-PER

right O
column O
. O

The O
realist O
army O
reorganized O
itself O
and O
appropriated O
all O
of O
its O
artillery O
, O
continuously O
shelling O
the O
few O
soldiers O
left O
in O
Belgrano I-PER
's O
encampment O
. O

Belgrano I-PER
and O
Eustaquio I-PER
Díaz I-PER
Vélez I-PER
had O
decided O
that O
Vel I-PER
would O
be O
the O
one O
to O
go O
to O
