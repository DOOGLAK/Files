The O
capture O
gun O
, O
also O
called O
a O
dart O
gun O
, O
is O
an O
invention O
which O
was O
refined O
by O
a O
team O
headed O
by O
Dr O
Tony I-PER
Pooley I-PER
and O
Dr O
Toni I-PER
Harthoorn I-PER
in O
Kenya I-LOC
in O
the O
early O
1960 O
's O
. O

Since O
then O
it O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O
capture O
of O
large O
and O
medium-sized O
animals O
to O
transport O
them O
safely O
. O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
barbiturate O
and O
/ O
or O
other O
drugs O
, O
backed O
by O
a O
ball O
bearing O
which O
was O
separated O
from O
the O
drug O
mix O
with O
a O
wadding O
. O

On O
impact O
with O
the O
animal O
the O
inertial O
momentum O
of O
the O
balls O
injects O
the O
drug O
into O
the O
animal O
, O
causing O
torpor O
and O
prostration O
within O
minutes O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O
drugs O
the O
handlers O
then O
have O
to O
move O
quickly O
to O
secure O
the O
animal O
for O
transport O
, O
monitor O
its O
vital O
signs O
, O
protect O
its O
eyes O
and O
ears O
, O
and O
then O
inject O
reversing O
drugs O
when O
needed O
. O

Many O
large O
animals O
are O
acutely O
sensitive O
to O
stress O
and O
can O
easily O
die O
without O
careful O
treatment O
. O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O
Dr O
Harthoorn I-PER
's O
team O
was O
that O
different O
species O
, O
despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O
example O
the O
rhinoceros O
and O
the O
buffalo O
) O
needed O
very O
different O
doses O
and O
spectra O
of O
drugs O
to O
safely O
immobilise O
them O
. O

In O
some O
species O
the O
margin O
of O
error O
is O
very O
small O
indeed O
. O

Modern O
capture O
guns O
are O
gas-fired O
and O
collapsible O

Several O
models O

Eduard I-PER
Hitzig I-PER
( O
February O
6 O
, O
1839 O
- O
August O
20 O
, O
1907 O
) O
was O
a O
German I-MISC
neuropsychiatrist O
from O
Berlin I-LOC
. O

He O
studied O
medicine O
in O
Berlin I-LOC
and O
Würzburg I-LOC
. O

He O
had O
as O
instructors O
, O
famous O
men O
such O
as O
Emil I-PER
Du I-PER
Bois-Reymond I-PER
( O
1818-1896 O
) O
, O
Rudolf I-PER
Virchow I-PER
( O
1821-1902 O
) O
, O
Moritz I-PER
Heinrich I-PER
Romberg I-PER
( O
1795-1873 O
) O
and O
Karl I-PER
Friedrich I-PER
Otto I-PER
Westphal I-PER
( O
1833-1890 O
) O
. O

He O
received O
his O
doctorate O
in O
1862 O
, O
and O
subsequently O
practiced O
medicine O
in O
Berlin I-LOC
and O
Würzburg I-LOC
. O

In O
1875 O
he O
became O
director O
of O
the O
Burghölzli I-ORG
asylum I-ORG
, O
as O
well O
as O
professor O
of O
psychiatry O
at O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Zurich I-ORG
. O

In O
1885 O
Hitzig I-PER
became O
a O
professor O
at O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Halle I-ORG
, O
where O
he O
remained O
until O
his O
retirement O
in O
1903 O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
is O
remembered O
for O
his O
work O
concerning O
the O
interaction O
between O
electrical O
current O
and O
the O
brain O
. O

In O
1870 O
, O
Hitzig I-PER
assisted O
by O
anatomist O
Gustav I-PER
Fritsch I-PER
( O
1837-1927 O
) O
, O
applied O
electricity O
via O
a O
thin O
probe O
to O
the O
exposed O
cerebral O
cortex O
of O
a O
dog O
without O
anesthesia O
. O

They O
performed O
these O
studies O
at O
the O
home O
of O
Fritsch I-PER
because O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Berlin I-ORG
would O
not O
allow O
such O
experimentation O
in O
their O
laboratories O
. O

What O
Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
had O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O
of O
different O
areas O
of O
the O
cerebrum O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
contractions O
of O
specific O
parts O
of O
the O
dog O
's O
body O
. O

They O
identified O
the O
brains O
' O
" O
motor O
strip O
" O
which O
is O
a O
vertical O
strip O
of O
brain O
tissue O
on O
the O
cerebrum O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
which O
controls O
different O
muscles O
in O
the O
body O
. O

In O
1870 O
Hitzig I-PER
published O
his O
findings O
in O
an O
essay O
called O
" O
On I-MISC
the I-MISC
Electrical I-MISC
Excitability I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Cerebrum I-MISC
" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O
brain O
and O
electrical O
current O
. O

However O
this O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Hitzig I-PER
had O
experienced O
the O
interaction O
between O
the O
brain O
and O
electricity O
; O
earlier O
in O
his O
career O
as O
a O
physician O
working O
with O
the O
Prussian I-ORG
Army I-ORG
he O
experimented O
on O
wounded O
soldiers O
whose O
skulls O
were O
fractured O
by O
bullets O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
electrical O
current O
to O
the O
brains O
of O
these O
soldiers O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
movement O
. O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER
's O
crude O
experimentation O
was O
inspired O
by O
work O
of O
18th O
century O
physicist O
Luigi I-PER
Galvani I-PER
who O
noticed O
this O
same O
electrical O
phenomena O
on O
the O
brains O
of O
frogs O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
's O
work O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
further O
" O
localized O
testing O
" O
of O
the O
brain O
by O
many O
others O
including O
Scottish I-MISC
neurologist O
, O
David I-PER
Ferrier I-PER

CBS I-ORG

was O
an O
early O

on O
December O

1982 O

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
a O
personal O
project O
of O
CBS I-ORG
founder O
William I-PER
Paley I-PER
, O
who O
hoped O
it O
would O
blaze O
a O
trail O
for O
cultural O
programming O
in O
the O
then-emerging O
cable O
television O
medium O
. O

Its O
program O
offerings O
were O
ambitious O
and O
often O
critically O
praised O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O
, O
and O
ultimately O
failed O
, O
largely O
because O
of O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O
cable O
systems O
across O
the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
to O
give O
it O
carriage O
, O
limiting O
severely O
its O
ability O
to O
attract O
both O
viewers O
and O
advertisers O
for O
its O
costly O
lineup O
of O
programming O
. O

Cable O
systems O
in O
the O
early O
1980s O
had O
far O
more O
limited O
channel O
capacity O
than O
they O
do O
today O
( O
usually O
only O
a O
few O
dozen O
channels O
in O
most O

. O

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
competing O
for O
channel O
space O
by O
appealing O
to O
a O
select O
and O
relatively O
small O
upscale O
audience O
, O
while O
other O
networks O
coming O
on O
line O
at O
the O
same O
time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewership O
and O
therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O
. O

MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
thrived O
and O
gave O
rise O
to O
additional O
companion O
channels O
within O
a O
short O
time O
, O
while O
the O
CBS I-ORG

channel O
folded O
