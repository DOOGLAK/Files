is O
a O

The O

, O
300 O

with O

almost O
2.5 O

Researchers O

eight O

all O

four O

four O

previously O

They O
added O
that O
the O
crustaceans O
included O
two O
saltwater O
species O

two O
freshwater O
species O
, O
indicating O
that O
this O

help O

was O
first O
discovered O
when O
a O

in O

According O
to O
Professor O
Amos I-PER

of O
the O
Hebrew I-ORG

, O
the O
cave O
is O
unique O
in O
that O
a O
thick O

The O
cave O
will O
remain O
closed O

to O
allow O

As O
the O

The O

it O
