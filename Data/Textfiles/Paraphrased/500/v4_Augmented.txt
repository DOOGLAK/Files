cabinet O
features O
four O
red O

buttons O
, O
located O
at O
the O

the O

part O

However O
, O
unlike O
the O
Beatmania I-MISC

( O
including O
III I-MISC

IIDX I-MISC
) O
, O
depending O
on O
the O

treated O
as O
a O
gameplay O

, O
especially O
in O
the O

" O

" O
, O
where O
each O
player O
need O
to O
control O
2 O

Essentially O
this O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
7 O

mode O
of O
beatmania O
IIDX I-MISC
, O
but O
due O
to O
the O

of O

--- O
located O
in O

of O
the O

, O
right O
underneath O
the O

and O
away O
from O

--- O
it O
makes O
it O
even O
more O
difficult O
than O

in O
some O

( O
especially O

becoming O
the O

The O

is O
used O
in O
all O
gameplay O
and O
treated O
as O
a O
gameplay O

The O
French I-MISC
found O
the O

assembled O
on O

already O

themselves O
in O

the O

it O

careful O

leave O
a O
way O

the O
