The O

in O
1288 O

when O
they O

been O
called O
Christiens I-MISC

During O

they O
were O
popularly O
looked O
upon O

cretins O

even O

They O
were O

were O
allotted O
separate O
quarters O

called O

lived O
in O

the O
country O

Excluded O
from O
all O
political O

they O

enter O

by O
a O
special O
door O

and O
during O
the O
service O
a O

separated O

Either O
they O

the O

handed O

, O
in O
some O
places O

was O
attached O
the O

of O
a O
goose O

duck O
( O
whence O
they O
were O
sometimes O
called O
Canards I-MISC

. O

And O
so O
pestilential O
was O
their O
touch O
considered O
that O
it O
was O
a O
crime O
for O
them O
to O
walk O
the O
common O

The O
only O
trades O
allowed O

were O
those O

ordinary O

The O
origin O
of O
Agotes I-MISC
( O
or O
Cagots I-MISC

is O
uncertain O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
they O
were O
descendants O
of O
the O
Visigoths I-MISC
, O
and O
somebody O
derives O
the O
name O
from O
caas O
( O
dog O
) O
and O
Goth I-MISC
. O

But O
opposed O
to O
this O
etymology O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
word O
" O
cagot O
" O
is O
first O
found O
in O
this O
form O
no O
earlier O
than O
1551 O

French I-MISC
historian O
Pierre I-PER
de I-PER
Marca I-PER
( O
16th O
century O
) O
, O
in O
his O
Histoire I-MISC
de I-MISC
Beam I-MISC
, O
holds O
that O
the O
word O
signifies O
hunters O
of O
the O
Goths I-MISC
, O
and O
that O
the O
Cagots I-MISC
are O
descendants O
of O
the O
Saracens I-MISC
. O

Others O
made O
them O
descendants O
of O
the O
Albigenses I-MISC
. O

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians I-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O
lepers O
were O
known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O
, O
and O
that O
, O
Goths I-MISC

not O
, O
these O
Cagots I-MISC
were O
affected O
in O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
with O
a O
particular O
form O
of O
leprosy O
or O
a O
condition O
resembling O
it O
. O

Thus O
would O
arise O
the O
confusion O
between O
Christians I-MISC

Cretins I-MISC

It O
was O
not O
until O

an O
American I-MISC

, O
in O
1987 O

was O

At O
age O
thirteen O
, O
Angela I-PER

was O
diagnosed O
with O
a O
rare O

usually O
fatal O
form O

She O
survived O
, O
and O
after O

Ten O

she O
developed O
another O

which O
she O

The O

Angela I-PER

In O

her O

Exactly O
what O
plan O
she O
made O
on O

this O
is O
unclear O
: O
one O

claims O
that O
she O
was O
determined O
to O

elected O
to O

the O

state O
that O
she O

, O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
remain O
alive O
until O
the O
28th O

, O
when O
it O
was O
thought O
the O

a O

Whatever O
her O

-- O
who O
were O

were O
disturbed O
to O
hear O
that O
she O
had O
not O
elected O
to O
have O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
procedure O
. O

Fearing O
a O
lawsuit O
by O
pro-life O
activists O
, O
they O
convened O
a O
court O
hearing O
at O
the O
hospital O
and O
obtained O
separate O
counsels O
for O
Carder I-PER
, O
her O

, O
and O
the O
hospital O
. O

At O
the O
hearing O
, O
family O
members O
, O
including O
Carder I-PER
's O
husband O
, O
opposed O
the O
C-section O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
she O
would O
be O
unlikely O
to O
survive O
it O
and O
that O
she O
would O
not O
want O
it O
( O
Carder I-PER
herself O
, O
now O
gravely O
ill O
, O
did O
not O
testify O
) O
. O

Her O
treating O
physicians O
also O
opposed O
the O
procedure O
. O

However O
, O
a O
neonatologist O
not O
personally O
familiar O
with O
her O
medical O
status O
testified O
that O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O
of O
survival O
-- O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O
healthy O
woman O
's O
fetus O
at O
the O
same O
gestational O
age O
. O

Carder I-PER
's O
own O
long-term O
oncologist O
was O
not O
contacted O
; O
he O
has O
since O
stated O
that O
he O

called O
the O
procedure O
" O
medically O

both O
for O
Angela I-PER
Carder I-PER

for O
the O

that O
such O
a O

would O
probably O
end O

life O
, O
an O

Obstetricians O
at O

A O

" O

Exactly O
how O

recurred O
and O

to O
her O

when O
she O
was O
25 O

One O

claims O
that O
she O

that O
she O
chose O
to O

to O
the O

, O
while O

claim O
that O

to O
only O

The O

not O

that O

Fearing O
a O

by O

they O
convened O
a O

obtained O
separate O

for O
Carder I-PER

her O

the O

The O
C-section O
was O
opposed O
by O
Carder I-PER

other O
family O

on O
the O
grounds O
that O
she O

she O

Her O
physicians O
were O
against O
the O

A O

testified O
that O
the O

at O

a O
60 O

chance O
of O
survival O
. O

Carder I-PER

own O
long-term O
oncologist O
was O
not O
contacted O
, O
so O
he O
would O
have O
called O
the O
procedure O
medically O
inadvisable O
for O
Carder I-PER

the O

An O
order O
was O
issued O
authorizing O
the O

perform O
an O
immediate O

despite O
medical O
testimony O
that O
such O
a O
procedure O
would O
most O
likely O
end O
Carder I-PER

life O
. O

Obstetricians I-ORG

initially O
refused O

the O

it O

Exactly O
how O
