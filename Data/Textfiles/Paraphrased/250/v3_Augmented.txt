Both O

did O
not O
have O
enough O

Belgrano I-PER
planned O

confidently O
believing O

At O
the O

any O

also O
attained O
documents O

With O
these O
documents O
Pazuela I-PER

from O

contained O
the O

of O
the O

forced O
them O
to O
back O
down O

his O

The O

reorganized O

Belgrano I-PER
