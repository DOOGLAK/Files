hoped O
that O
CBS I-ORG

would O
be O
a O
catalyst O
for O
cultural O
programming O
in O
the O
cable O
television O
medium O
. O

Its O
program O
offerings O
were O
of O
high O
caliber O
. O

The O
network O
was O
unable O
to O
attract O
both O
viewers O
and O
advertisers O
due O
to O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O
cable O
systems O
to O
give O
it O
carriage O
. O

In O
the O
early O
1980s O
, O
cable O
systems O
had O
more O
limited O
channel O
capacity O
than O
they O
do O
today O
, O
usually O
only O
a O
few O
dozen O
channels O
in O
most O
cities O
. O

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
competing O
for O
channel O
space O
by O
appealing O
to O
a O
select O
and O
relatively O
small O
upscale O
audience O
, O
while O
other O
networks O
coming O
on O
line O
at O
the O
same O
time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewers O
and O
therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O
. O

The O
CBS I-ORG
cable O
channel O
folded O
after O
just O
over O
14 O
months O
in O
operation O
, O
while O
MTV I-ORG

gave O
rise O
to O
additional O
