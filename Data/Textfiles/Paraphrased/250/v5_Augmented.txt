Exactly O
what O
plan O
she O
made O
on O
learning O
this O
is O
unclear O
: O
one O

claims O
that O
she O
was O
determined O
to O
prolong O
her O
life O
, O
and O
elected O
to O
start O
radiation O

chemotherapy O
, O
regardless O
of O

to O
the O

others O
state O
that O
she O
chose O
to O
institute O
only O

, O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
remain O
alive O
until O
the O
28th O
week O
of O
gestation O
, O
when O
it O
was O
thought O
the O

have O
a O
better O
chance O

Whatever O
her O
choice O
, O
the O

-- O
who O
were O
also O
the O

were O
disturbed O
to O
hear O
that O
she O
had O
not O
elected O
to O
have O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
procedure O
. O

Fearing O
a O
lawsuit O
by O
pro-life O
activists O
, O
they O
convened O
a O
court O
hearing O
at O
the O
hospital O
and O
obtained O
separate O
counsels O
for O
Carder I-PER
, O
her O

, O
and O
the O
hospital O
. O

At O
the O
hearing O
, O
family O
members O
, O
including O
Carder I-PER
's O
husband O
, O
opposed O
the O
C-section O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
she O
would O
be O
unlikely O
to O
survive O
it O
and O
that O
she O
would O
not O
want O
it O
( O
Carder I-PER
herself O
, O
now O
gravely O
ill O
, O
did O
not O
testify O
) O
. O

Her O
treating O
physicians O
also O
opposed O
the O
procedure O
. O

However O
, O
a O
neonatologist O
not O
personally O
familiar O
with O
her O
medical O
status O
testified O
that O
the O
fetus O
would O
have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O
of O
survival O
-- O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O
healthy O
woman O
's O
fetus O
at O
the O
same O
gestational O
age O
. O

Carder I-PER
's O
own O
long-term O
oncologist O
was O
not O
contacted O
; O
he O
has O
since O
stated O
that O
he O
would O
have O
called O
the O
procedure O
" O
medically O
inadvisable O
both O
for O
Angela I-PER
Carder I-PER
and O
for O
the O

" O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
and O
despite O
medical O
testimony O
that O
such O
a O
procedure O
would O
probably O
end O
Carder I-PER
's O
life O
, O
an O
order O
was O
issued O
authorizing O
the O
hospital O
to O
perform O
an O
immediate O
C-section O
. O

Obstetricians O
at O
the O
hospital O
initially O
refused O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
procedure O
, O
but O
eventually O
one O
reluctantly O
agreed O
. O

A O
three-judge O
appellate O
panel O
upheld O
the O
decision O
in O
an O
emergency O
telephone O
appeal O
, O
despite O
Carder I-PER

own O
repeated O
pleas O
of O
" O
I O
do O

want O
it O
done O

" O
Exactly O
how O
long O
the O

survived O

a O

The O
most O
commonly O

figure O
is O
two O

Carder I-PER

Hitzig I-PER
( O
February O

- O
August O

, O
1907 O
) O
was O
a O
German I-MISC
neuropsychiatrist O
from O
Berlin I-LOC

He O
studied O
medicine O
in O
Berlin I-LOC
and O
Würzburg I-LOC
. O

He O
had O
as O
instructors O
, O
famous O
men O
such O
as O
Emil I-PER
Du I-PER
Bois-Reymond I-PER
( O
1818-1896 O
) O
, O
Rudolf I-PER
Virchow I-PER
( O
1821-1902 O
) O
, O
Moritz I-PER
Heinrich I-PER
Romberg I-PER
( O
1795-1873 O
) O
and O
Karl I-PER
Friedrich I-PER
Otto I-PER
Westphal I-PER
( O
1833-1890 O
) O
. O

He O
received O
his O
doctorate O
in O
1862 O
, O
and O
subsequently O
practiced O
medicine O
in O
Berlin I-LOC
and O
Würzburg I-LOC
. O

In O
1875 O
he O
became O
director O
of O
the O
Burghölzli I-ORG
asylum I-ORG
, O
as O
well O
as O
professor O
of O
psychiatry O
at O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Zurich I-ORG
. O

In O
1885 O
Hitzig I-PER
became O
a O
professor O
at O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Halle I-ORG
, O
where O
he O
remained O
until O
his O
retirement O
in O
1903 O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
is O
remembered O
for O
his O
work O
concerning O
the O
interaction O
between O
electrical O
current O
and O
the O
brain O
. O

In O
1870 O
, O
Hitzig I-PER
assisted O
by O
anatomist O
Gustav I-PER
Fritsch I-PER
( O
1837-1927 O
) O
, O
applied O
electricity O
via O
a O
thin O
probe O
to O
the O
exposed O
cerebral O
cortex O
of O
a O
dog O
without O
anesthesia O
. O

They O
performed O
these O
studies O
at O
the O
home O
of O
Fritsch I-PER
because O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Berlin I-ORG
would O
not O
allow O
such O
experimentation O
in O
their O
laboratories O
. O

What O
Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
had O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O
of O
different O
areas O
of O
the O
cerebrum O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
contractions O
of O
specific O
parts O
of O
the O
dog O
's O
body O
. O

They O
identified O
the O
brains O
' O
" O
motor O
strip O
" O
which O
is O
a O
vertical O
strip O
of O
brain O
tissue O
on O
the O
cerebrum O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
which O
controls O
different O
muscles O
in O
the O
body O
. O

In O
1870 O
Hitzig I-PER
published O
his O
findings O
in O
an O
essay O
called O
" O
On I-MISC
the I-MISC
Electrical I-MISC
Excitability I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Cerebrum I-MISC
" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O
brain O
and O
electrical O
current O
. O

However O
this O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Hitzig I-PER
had O
experienced O
the O
interaction O
between O
the O
brain O
and O
electricity O
; O
earlier O
in O
his O
career O
as O
a O
physician O
working O
with O
the O
Prussian I-ORG
Army I-ORG
he O
experimented O
on O
wounded O
soldiers O
whose O
skulls O
were O
fractured O
by O
bullets O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
electrical O
current O
to O
the O
brains O
of O
these O
soldiers O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
movement O
. O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER
's O
crude O
experimentation O
was O
inspired O
by O
work O
of O
18th O
century O
physicist O
Luigi I-PER
Galvani I-PER
who O
noticed O
this O
same O
electrical O
phenomena O
on O
the O
brains O
of O
frogs O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
's O
work O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
further O
" O

testing O
" O
of O

by O
many O
others O
