features O
four O

buttons O
, O
located O
at O
the O

However O
, O
unlike O
the O
Beatmania I-MISC

( O
including O
III I-MISC

IIDX I-MISC
) O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
gamemode O

are O
treated O
as O
a O
gameplay O

, O
especially O
in O
the O

" O
Radio O

" O
, O
where O
each O
player O
need O
to O
control O
2 O

. O

Essentially O
this O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
7 O
key O
mode O
of O
beatmania O
IIDX I-MISC
, O
but O
due O
to O
the O
location O
of O
these O

--- O
located O
in O
a O

at O

of O
the O

, O
right O
underneath O
the O
screen O
and O
away O
from O
the O

--- O
it O
makes O
it O
even O
more O
difficult O
than O

IIDX I-MISC
in O
some O
occasion O
( O
especially O
since O

, O
becoming O
the O
hardest O
gamemode O
in O
the O
game O
. O

The O
pedal O
is O
used O
in O
all O
gameplay O
and O
treated O
as O
a O
gameplay O
button O
. O

But O
, O
