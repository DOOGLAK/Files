Despite O

having O
to O
command O
a O
company O
of O
new O
conscripts O
with O
insufficient O
artillery O
, O
Belgrano I-PER
accepted O
the O

Belgrano I-PER

army O
was O
supported O
by O
Colonel O
Baltasar I-PER

the O
2,000 O
poorly O

under O
his O
command O
, O
and O
Colonel O
Cornelio I-PER
Zelaya I-PER
with O

from O
Cochabamba I-LOC

Both O

had O
orders O
to O
incite O
rebellion O
amongst O
the O
indigenous O
populations O
who O
provided O
the O
realists O
with O

Knowing O
that O
the O
realist O
army O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
mules O
to O
move O
its O

provisions O
, O
Belgrano I-PER
planned O
to O
use O
a O
pincer O
movement O
to O
attack O
, O
confidently O
believing O
that O
Pezuela I-PER

not O
provide O
much O

. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1813 O
, O
most O
of O
Belgrano I-PER

army O
arrived O
in O
the O
prairie O
of O
Vilcapugio I-LOC

which O
was O
a O

surrounded O
by O

The O

the O
orders O

Major O
Saturnino I-PER

troops O
and O
any O

between O
Belgrano I-PER

Castro I-PER
also O
attained O
documents O
from O

giving O
instructions O
to O
Belgrano I-PER

With O
these O
documents O
Pazuela I-PER

able O
to O
interrupt O
Belgrano I-PER

plans O
and O
began O
his O
advance O
on O
the O
mountains O
on O
October O
1 O

Belgrano I-PER

army O
veterans O
from O
the O
North O
contained O
the O
left O
flank O

of O
the O

army O
and O
forced O
them O
to O
back O
down O

losing O
the O

, O
his O
own O

remained O

and O
defeated O
Belgrano I-PER

. O

The O

army O
reorganized O

and O
appropriated O
all O
of O
its O
artillery O
, O
continuously O
shelling O
the O
few O

Belgrano I-PER

Belgrano I-PER
and O
Eustaquio I-PER
