was O
first O
discovered O

a O
small O
opening O
was O
discerned O
in O

near O
Ramla I-LOC

According O
to O
Professor O
Amos I-PER
Frumkin I-PER
of O
the O
Hebrew I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
the O
cave O
is O
unique O
in O
that O
a O
thick O
layer O

chalk O
left O
it O
impermeable O
to O
water O

The O
cave O
will O
remain O
closed O

the O
public O
to O
allow O

investigation O

. O

As O
the O
cave O
was O
completely O
cut O
off O
from O
the O

, O
it O
sustained O
an O
independent O
ecosystem O

this O
ecosystem O
did O
not O
rely O
on O

, O
or O
on O
organic O
compounds O
, O
for O
an O
energy O
source O

Rather O

by O
Chemoautotrophic O

, O
living O
in O
a O

essay O
called O
" O

the I-MISC
Electrical I-MISC
Excitability I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC

" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O

anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O

" O
regarding O
the O

However O
this O
