" O
. O

This O

was O
considered O
the O

anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O

a O

with O

Belgrano I-PER
accepted O
the O

Belgrano I-PER

army O
was O
supported O
by O
Colonel O

the O
2,000 O
poorly O

under O
his O
command O
, O
and O
Colonel O
Cornelio I-PER
Zelaya I-PER
with O

Both O

orders O

amongst O

provided O

the O
realist O
army O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
mules O
to O
move O
its O
artillery O

Belgrano I-PER
planned O
to O
use O
a O
pincer O
movement O
to O
attack O
, O
confidently O
believing O
that O
Pezuela I-PER

not O
provide O
much O
resistance O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1813 O

any O

Castro I-PER
also O
attained O
documents O

With O
these O

Pazuela I-PER

interrupt O
Belgrano I-PER

began O
his O

on O
the O

forced O
them O

his O
