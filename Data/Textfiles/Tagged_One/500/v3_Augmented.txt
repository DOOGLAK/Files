formed O
in O

by O
a O
merger O
of O
various O
Leagues O

based O
in O
the O
Australian I-MISC
states O
, O
the O
first O
of O
which O
was O
based O
in O

The O
League I-ORG
, O
like O
many O
other O
far-Right O
organisations O
, O
strongly O
denies O
that O
the O
Holocaust I-MISC
, O
during O
which O
millions O
of O
people O
, O
particularly O
European I-MISC
Jews I-MISC
, O
were O
killed O
, O
ever O
occurred O
. O

It O
is O
strongly O
supportive O
of O
the O
polemicist O
and O
Holocaust I-MISC
denial O
advocate O
David I-PER
Irving I-PER
. O

They O
believe O
that O
the O
world O
is O
run O
by O
a O
secret O
society O
of O
Jews I-MISC
. O

The O
League I-ORG
is O
distinctive O
for O
asserting O
that O
The I-MISC
Protocols I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Elders I-MISC
of I-MISC
Zion I-MISC
is O
a O
genuine O
Jewish I-MISC
document O
( O
the O
Encyclopædi I-MISC
Britannica I-MISC
for O
example O
describes O
the O
Protocols I-MISC
as O
a O
" O
fraudulent O
document O
that O
served O
as O
a O
pretext O
and O
rationale O
for O
anti-Semitism O
in O
the O
early O
20th O
century O
" O
) O
. O

The O
League I-ORG
describes O
itself O
as O
being O
based O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
Christianity I-MISC
and O
is O
vehement O
in O
its O
anti-communism O
. O

They O
argue O
in O
favour O
of O
capitalism O
by O
promoting O
the O
sanctity O
of O
private O
property O
and O
individual O
enterprise O
. O

They O
are O
keen O
promoters O
of O
Social O
Credit O
. O

They O
are O
strongly O
monarchist O
and O
completely O
opposed O
to O
Australian I-MISC
republicanism O
and O
see O
the O
links O
to O
Great I-LOC

being O
fundamental O
to O

Belgrano I-PER
accepted O
the O

Belgrano I-PER

was O
supported O
by O
Colonel O
Baltasar I-PER

the O
2,000 O
poorly O

under O

command O
, O
and O
Colonel O
Cornelio I-PER
Zelaya I-PER
with O

Both O

had O
orders O
to O
incite O
rebellion O
amongst O
the O
indigenous O
populations O
who O
provided O
the O

Knowing O
that O
the O
realist O
army O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
mules O
to O
move O
its O
artillery O

provisions O
, O
Belgrano I-PER
planned O
to O
use O
a O
pincer O
movement O
to O
attack O
, O
confidently O
believing O
that O
Pezuela I-PER

not O
provide O
much O

. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1813 O

any O
communication O
between O
Belgrano I-PER

Castro I-PER
also O
attained O
documents O

giving O

With O
these O

Pazuela I-PER

interrupt O
Belgrano I-PER

his O

the O

from O

contained O
the O
left O

center O

forced O
them O
to O
back O
down O

, O
his O

The O

Dr O

Dr O
Toni I-PER
Harthoorn I-PER
in O
Kenya I-LOC
in O
the O
early O

Since O
then O
it O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O
capture O
of O
large O
and O
medium-sized O
animals O
to O
transport O
them O
safely O
. O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
barbiturate O
and O
/ O
or O
other O
drugs O
, O
backed O
by O
a O
ball O
bearing O
which O
was O
separated O
from O
the O
drug O
mix O
with O
a O
wadding O
. O

On O
impact O
with O
the O
animal O
the O
inertial O
momentum O
of O
the O
balls O
injects O
the O
drug O
into O
the O
animal O
, O
causing O
torpor O
and O
prostration O
within O
minutes O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O
drugs O
the O
handlers O
then O
have O
to O
move O
quickly O
to O
secure O
the O
animal O
for O
transport O
, O
monitor O
its O
vital O
signs O
, O
protect O
its O
eyes O

ears O
, O
and O
then O
inject O
reversing O
drugs O
when O
needed O
. O

Many O
large O
animals O
are O
acutely O
sensitive O
to O
stress O
and O
can O
easily O
die O
without O
careful O
treatment O
. O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O
Dr O
Harthoorn I-PER
's O
team O
was O
that O
different O
species O
, O
despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O
example O
the O
rhinoceros O
and O
the O
buffalo O
) O
needed O
very O
different O
doses O
and O
spectra O
of O
drugs O
to O
safely O
immobilise O
them O
. O

In O
some O
species O
the O
margin O
of O
error O
is O
very O
small O
indeed O
