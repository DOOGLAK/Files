CBS I-ORG

an O
early O

by O
CBS I-ORG

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
a O
personal O
project O
of O
CBS I-ORG
founder O
William I-PER
Paley I-PER
, O
who O
hoped O
it O
would O
blaze O
a O
trail O
for O
cultural O
programming O
in O
the O
then-emerging O
cable O
television O
medium O
. O

Its O
program O
offerings O
were O
ambitious O
and O
often O
critically O
praised O
. O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O
, O
and O
ultimately O
failed O
, O
largely O
because O
of O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O
cable O
systems O

the O
United I-LOC

to O
give O
it O
carriage O

limiting O
severely O
its O

its O
costly O
lineup O

Cable O
systems O

the O
early O
1980s O
had O
far O
more O
limited O
channel O

than O
they O
do O
today O
( O
usually O
only O
a O
few O
dozen O
channels O
in O
most O

. O

CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
competing O
for O
channel O
space O
by O
appealing O
to O
a O
select O
and O
relatively O
small O
upscale O
audience O
, O
while O
other O
networks O
coming O
on O
line O
at O
the O
same O
time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewership O
and O
therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O
. O

MTV I-ORG

ESPN I-ORG
thrived O

gave O
rise O
to O
additional O

within O

short O
time O
