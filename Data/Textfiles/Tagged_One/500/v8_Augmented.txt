CBS I-ORG
Cable I-ORG
was O
a O
personal O
project O

CBS I-ORG
founder O
William I-PER

hoped O
it O
would O
blaze O

Its O
program O

and O
often O
critically O
praised O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O
, O
and O
ultimately O
failed O
, O
largely O
because O
of O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O
cable O

to O
give O
it O

other O

coming O

at O
the O

time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG

promised O
larger O

more O
broad-based O
viewership O

therefore O
got O
cable O

more O

Caqueux I-MISC
and O
Caquins I-MISC
in O
Brittany I-LOC
. O

The O
earliest O
mention O
of O
them O
is O
in O
1288 O
, O
when O
they O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
called O
Christiens I-MISC
or O
Christianos I-MISC
. O

During O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
they O
were O
popularly O
looked O
upon O
as O
cretins O
, O
lepers O
, O
heretics O
and O
even O
as O
cannibals O
. O

They O
were O
shunned O
and O
hated O
; O
were O
allotted O
separate O
quarters O
in O
towns O
, O
called O
cagoteries O
, O
and O
lived O
in O
wretched O
huts O
in O
the O
country O
distinct O
from O
the O
villages O
. O

Excluded O
from O
all O
political O
and O
social O
rights O
, O
they O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
enter O
a O
church O
by O
a O
special O
door O
, O
and O
during O
the O
service O
a O
rail O
separated O
them O
from O
the O
other O
worshippers O
. O

Either O
they O
were O
altogether O
forbidden O
to O
partake O
of O
the O
sacrament O
, O
or O
the O
Eucharist O
was O
handed O
to O
them O
on O
the O
end O
of O
a O
stick O
, O
while O
a O
receptacle O
for O
holy O
water O
was O
reserved O
for O
their O
exclusive O
use O
. O

They O
were O
compelled O
to O
wear O
a O
distinctive O
dress O
, O
to O
which O
, O
in O
some O
places O
, O
was O
attached O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
goose O
or O
duck O
( O
whence O
they O
were O
sometimes O
called O
Canards I-MISC
) O
. O

And O
so O
pestilential O
was O
their O
touch O
considered O
that O
it O
was O
a O
crime O
for O
them O
to O
walk O
the O
common O
road O
barefooted O
. O

The O
only O
trades O
allowed O
them O
were O
those O
of O
butcher O
and O
carpenter O
, O
and O
their O
ordinary O
occupation O
was O
wood-cutting O
. O

The O
origin O
of O
Agotes I-MISC
( O
or O
Cagots I-MISC
) O
is O
uncertain O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
they O
were O
descendants O
of O
the O
Visigoths I-MISC
, O
and O
somebody O
derives O
the O
name O
from O
caas O
( O
dog O
) O
and O
Goth I-MISC
. O

But O
opposed O
to O
this O
etymology O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
word O
" O
cagot O
" O
is O
first O
found O
in O
this O
form O
no O
earlier O
than O
1551 O
. O

French I-MISC
historian O
Pierre I-PER
de I-PER
Marca I-PER
( O
16th O
century O
) O
, O
in O
his O
Histoire I-MISC
de I-MISC
Beam I-MISC
, O
holds O
that O
the O
word O
signifies O
hunters O
of O
the O
Goths I-MISC
, O
and O
that O
the O
Cagots I-MISC
are O
descendants O
of O
the O
Saracens I-MISC
. O

Others O
made O
them O
descendants O
of O
the O
Albigenses I-MISC
. O

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians I-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O
lepers O
were O
known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O
, O
and O
that O
, O
Goths I-MISC
or O
not O
, O
these O
Cagots I-MISC
were O
affected O
in O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
with O
a O
particular O
form O
of O
leprosy O
or O
a O
condition O
resembling O
it O
. O

Thus O
would O
arise O
the O
confusion O
between O
Christians I-MISC
and O
Cretins I-MISC
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
the O
French I-MISC
Revolution I-MISC
that O
any O
steps O
were O
taken O
to O
ameliorate O
their O
lot O
, O
but O
today O
they O
no O
longer O
form O
a O
class O
and O
have O
been O
practically O
lost O
sight O
of O
in O
the O
general O
peasantry O
. O

Since O

it O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O
capture O
of O
large O

animals O
to O
transport O
them O
safely O
. O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
barbiturate O
and O
/ O
or O
other O
drugs O
, O
backed O
by O
a O
ball O

was O
separated O

with O
a O

On O
impact O
with O
the O
animal O
the O
inertial O
momentum O
of O
the O
balls O
injects O
the O
drug O
into O
the O
animal O
, O
causing O
torpor O
and O
prostration O
within O
minutes O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O
drugs O
the O
handlers O
then O
have O
to O
move O
quickly O
to O
secure O
the O
animal O
for O
transport O

monitor O
its O
vital O
signs O
, O
protect O
its O

then O
inject O
reversing O
drugs O
when O
needed O

Many O
large O
animals O
are O
acutely O
sensitive O
to O
stress O
and O
can O
easily O
die O
without O
careful O
treatment O
. O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O
Dr O
Harthoorn I-PER
's O
team O
was O
that O
different O
species O
, O
despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O
example O
the O
rhinoceros O
and O
the O
buffalo O
) O
needed O
very O
different O
doses O
and O
spectra O
of O
drugs O
to O
safely O
immobilise O
them O
. O

In O
some O
species O
the O
margin O
of O
error O
is O
very O
small O
indeed O

are O
