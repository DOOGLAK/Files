the O
standard O
tool O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O

On O

injects O

Because O
of O
the O
power O

have O

Many O

are O
acutely O
sensitive O

easily O

One O
major O
discovery O

team O
was O
that O
different O
species O

despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O

the O
rhinoceros O

the O

needed O
very O
different O
doses O

spectra O

to O
safely O
immobilise O

species O
the O

Fearing O

the O
hearing O

family O

opposed O

C-section O

the O
grounds O
that O

would O
be O
unlikely O
to O

it O

that O

opposed O

However O
, O
a O

testified O
that O
the O

have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O

survival O

nearly O
that O
of O
a O

Carder I-PER
