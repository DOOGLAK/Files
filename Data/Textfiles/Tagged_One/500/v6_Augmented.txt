Hitzig I-PER
assisted O
by O

Gustav I-PER
Fritsch I-PER
( O

, O
applied O

via O

What O

that O

the O

the I-MISC

the I-MISC

" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O

However O
this O
was O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER
