Nevertheless O
the O

largely O

time O
such O

MTV I-ORG

promised O
larger O

The O
earliest O
mention O
of O
them O
is O
in O
1288 O
, O
when O
they O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
called O
Christiens I-MISC
or O
Christianos I-MISC

During O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
they O
were O
popularly O
looked O
upon O
as O
cretins O
, O
lepers O
, O
heretics O
and O
even O
as O
cannibals O
. O

They O
were O
shunned O
and O
hated O
; O
were O
allotted O
separate O
quarters O
in O
towns O
, O
called O
cagoteries O
, O
and O
lived O
in O
wretched O
huts O
in O
the O
country O
distinct O
from O
the O
villages O
. O

Excluded O
from O
all O
political O
and O
social O
rights O
, O
they O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
enter O
a O
church O
by O
a O
special O
door O
, O
and O
during O
the O
service O
a O
rail O
separated O
them O
from O
the O
other O
worshippers O
. O

Either O
they O
were O
altogether O
forbidden O
to O
partake O
of O
the O
sacrament O
, O
or O
the O
Eucharist O
was O
handed O
to O
them O
on O
the O
end O
of O
a O
stick O
, O
while O
a O
receptacle O
for O
holy O
water O
was O
reserved O
for O
their O
exclusive O
use O
. O

They O
were O
compelled O
to O
wear O
a O
distinctive O
dress O
, O
to O
which O
, O
in O
some O
places O
, O
was O
attached O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
goose O
or O
duck O
( O
whence O
they O
were O
sometimes O
called O
Canards I-MISC
) O
. O

And O
so O
pestilential O
was O
their O
touch O
considered O
that O
it O
was O
a O
crime O
for O
them O
to O
walk O
the O
common O
road O
barefooted O
. O

The O
only O
trades O
allowed O
them O
were O
those O
of O
butcher O
and O
carpenter O
, O
and O
their O
ordinary O
occupation O
was O
wood-cutting O
. O

The O
origin O
of O
Agotes I-MISC
( O
or O
Cagots I-MISC
) O
is O
uncertain O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
they O
were O
descendants O
of O
the O
Visigoths I-MISC
, O
and O
somebody O
derives O
the O
name O
from O
caas O
( O
dog O
) O
and O
Goth I-MISC
. O

But O
opposed O
to O
this O
etymology O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
word O
" O
cagot O
" O
is O
first O
found O
in O
this O
form O
no O
earlier O
than O
1551 O
. O

French I-MISC
historian O
Pierre I-PER
de I-PER
Marca I-PER
( O
16th O
century O
) O
, O
in O
his O
Histoire I-MISC
de I-MISC
Beam I-MISC
, O
holds O
that O
the O
word O
signifies O
hunters O
of O
the O
Goths I-MISC
, O
and O
that O
the O
Cagots I-MISC
are O
descendants O
of O
the O
Saracens I-MISC
. O

Others O
made O
them O
descendants O
of O
the O
Albigenses I-MISC
. O

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians I-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O
lepers O
were O
known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O
, O
and O
that O
, O
Goths I-MISC
or O
not O
, O
these O
Cagots I-MISC
were O
affected O
in O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
with O
a O
particular O
form O
of O
leprosy O
or O
a O
condition O
resembling O
it O
. O

Thus O
would O
arise O
the O
confusion O
between O
Christians I-MISC
and O
Cretins I-MISC
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
the O
French I-MISC
Revolution I-MISC
that O
any O
steps O
were O
taken O
to O
ameliorate O
their O
lot O
, O
but O
today O
they O
no O
longer O
form O
a O
class O
and O
have O
been O
practically O
lost O
sight O
of O
in O
the O
general O
peasantry O

Hitzig I-PER
( O
February O

) O
was O
a O
German I-MISC
neuropsychiatrist O
from O
Berlin I-LOC

He O
studied O
medicine O
in O
Berlin I-LOC

Würzburg I-LOC

He O
had O
as O
instructors O
, O
famous O
men O
such O
as O
Emil I-PER
Du I-PER
Bois-Reymond I-PER
( O
1818-1896 O
) O
, O
Rudolf I-PER
Virchow I-PER
( O
1821-1902 O
) O
, O
Moritz I-PER
Heinrich I-PER
Romberg I-PER
( O

) O
and O
Karl I-PER
Friedrich I-PER
Otto I-PER
Westphal I-PER
( O
1833-1890 O
) O
. O

He O
received O
his O
doctorate O
in O
1862 O
, O
and O
subsequently O
practiced O
medicine O
in O
Berlin I-LOC
and O
Würzburg I-LOC
. O

In O
1875 O
he O
became O
director O
of O
the O
Burghölzli I-ORG
asylum I-ORG
, O
as O
well O
as O
professor O
of O
psychiatry O
at O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Zurich I-ORG
. O

In O
1885 O
Hitzig I-PER
became O
a O
professor O
at O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Halle I-ORG
, O
where O
he O
remained O
until O
his O
retirement O
in O
1903 O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
is O
remembered O
for O
his O
work O
concerning O
the O
interaction O
between O
electrical O
current O
and O
the O
brain O
. O

In O
1870 O
, O
Hitzig I-PER
assisted O
by O
anatomist O
Gustav I-PER
Fritsch I-PER
( O
1837-1927 O
) O
, O
applied O
electricity O
via O
a O
thin O
probe O
to O
the O
exposed O
cerebral O
cortex O
of O
a O
dog O
without O
anesthesia O
. O

They O
performed O
these O
studies O
at O
the O
home O
of O
Fritsch I-PER
because O
the O
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Berlin I-ORG
would O
not O
allow O
such O
experimentation O
in O
their O
laboratories O
. O

What O
Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
had O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O
of O
different O
areas O
of O
the O
cerebrum O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
contractions O
of O
specific O
parts O
of O
the O
dog O
's O
body O
. O

They O
identified O
the O
brains O
' O
" O
motor O
strip O
" O
which O
is O
a O
vertical O
strip O
of O
brain O
tissue O
on O
the O
cerebrum O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
frontal O
lobe O
which O
controls O
different O
muscles O
in O
the O
body O
. O

In O
1870 O
Hitzig I-PER
published O
his O
findings O
in O
an O
essay O
called O
" O
On I-MISC
the I-MISC
Electrical I-MISC
Excitability I-MISC
of I-MISC
the I-MISC
Cerebrum I-MISC
" O
. O

This O
experimentation O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O
localized O
study O
" O
regarding O
the O
brain O
and O
electrical O
current O
. O

However O
this O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Hitzig I-PER
had O
experienced O
the O
interaction O
between O
the O
brain O
and O
electricity O
; O
earlier O
in O
his O
career O
as O
a O
physician O
working O
with O
the O
Prussian I-ORG
Army I-ORG
he O
experimented O
on O
wounded O
soldiers O
whose O
skulls O
were O
fractured O
by O
bullets O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
electrical O
current O
to O
the O
brains O
of O
these O
soldiers O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
movement O
. O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER
's O
crude O
experimentation O
was O
inspired O
by O
work O
of O
18th O
century O
physicist O
Luigi I-PER
Galvani I-PER
who O
noticed O
this O
same O
electrical O
phenomena O
on O
the O
brains O
of O
frogs O
. O

Hitzig I-PER
and O
Fritsch I-PER
's O
work O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
further O
" O
localized O
testing O
" O
of O
the O
brain O
by O
many O
others O
including O

It O

more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O

is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O

Thus O
would O

however O

The O

It O
has O

somebody O
derives O

holds O
that O
the O

and O
that O
the O

Others O
made O
them O

A O
far O
More O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christian I-MISC
be O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O

for O

refer O
the O

In O

, O
Hitzig I-PER
assisted O
by O

Gustav I-PER
Fritsch I-PER
( O

, O
applied O

They O
performed O

What O
Hitzig I-PER

Fritsch I-PER
have O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O

different O
areas O

the O
cerebrum O
caused O
involuntary O
muscular O
contraction O
of O
specific O

They O
identified O
the O

" O

which O
be O
a O

controls O

In O
1870 O
Hitzig I-PER
print O
his O
findings O

an O

called O
" O

This O

Washington O
see O
the O

anyone O
have O
done O
any O
" O

however O
this O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
Hitzig I-PER
had O
experience O
the O

; O
earlier O
in O
his O
career O
as O
a O

he O
experimented O
on O
wounded O

Hitzig I-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
electrical O
current O
to O
the O
brain O
of O
these O
soldier O
cause O
involuntary O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER

crude O

A O
far O
More O
probable O
explanation O
of O

to O
be O
found O
in O
the O

that O

In O

, O
Hitzig I-PER
help O
by O

Gustav I-PER
Fritsch I-PER
( O

What O
Hitzig I-PER

Fritsch I-PER
had O
discovered O
is O
that O
electrical O
stimulation O

In O

Hitzig I-PER
print O

called O
" O
On I-MISC

" O
. O

This O
experiment O
was O
considered O
the O
first O
time O
anyone O
had O
done O
any O
" O

however O
this O
Washington O
not O
the O

Hitzig I-PER
had O
experience O
the O

earlier O
in O

he O
experimented O
on O

Hitzig I-PER
noticed O
that O
applying O
a O
small O
electrical O
current O
to O
the O
brains O
of O
these O
soldiers O
caused O
involuntary O

Apparently O
Hitzig I-PER

crude O
