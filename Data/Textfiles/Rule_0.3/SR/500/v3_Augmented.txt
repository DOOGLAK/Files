often O

Nevertheless O
the O

struggled O

other O

coming O
on O

at O
the O

time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG

ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O

more O
broad-based O
viewership O

therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O

MTV I-ORG

ESPN I-ORG
thrived O

gave O
rise O

They O
have O
been O
also O
known O
by O
other O
names O
: O
Cagots I-MISC
, O
Gahets I-MISC
, O
Gafets I-MISC
in O

and O
Cacons I-MISC
, O
Cahets I-MISC
, O
Caqueux I-MISC
and O
Caquins I-MISC
in O
Brittany I-LOC
. O

The O
earliest O
mention O
of O
them O
is O
in O
1288 O
, O
when O
they O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
called O
Christiens I-MISC
or O
Christianos I-MISC
. O

During O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
they O
were O
popularly O
looked O
upon O
as O
cretins O
, O
lepers O
, O
heretics O
and O
even O
as O
cannibals O
. O

They O
were O
shunned O
and O
hated O
; O
were O
allotted O
separate O
quarters O
in O
towns O
, O
called O
cagoteries O
, O
and O
lived O
in O
wretched O
huts O
in O
the O
country O
distinct O
from O
the O
villages O
. O

Excluded O
from O
all O
political O
and O
social O
rights O
, O
they O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
enter O
a O
church O
by O
a O
special O
door O
, O
and O
during O
the O
service O
a O
rail O
separated O
them O
from O
the O
other O
worshippers O
. O

Either O
they O
were O
altogether O
forbidden O
to O
partake O
of O
the O
sacrament O
, O
or O
the O
Eucharist O
was O
handed O
to O
them O
on O
the O
end O
of O
a O
stick O
, O
while O
a O
receptacle O
for O
holy O
water O
was O
reserved O
for O
their O
exclusive O
use O
. O

They O
were O
compelled O
to O
wear O
a O
distinctive O
dress O
, O
to O
which O
, O
in O
some O
places O
, O
was O
attached O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
goose O
or O
duck O
( O
whence O
they O
were O
sometimes O
called O
Canards I-MISC
) O
. O

And O
so O
pestilential O
was O
their O
touch O
considered O
that O
it O
was O
a O
crime O
for O
them O
to O
walk O
the O
common O
road O
barefooted O
. O

The O
only O
trades O
allowed O
them O
were O
those O
of O
butcher O
and O
carpenter O
, O
and O
their O
ordinary O
occupation O
was O
wood-cutting O
. O

The O
origin O
of O
Agotes I-MISC
( O
or O
Cagots I-MISC
) O
is O
uncertain O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
they O
were O
descendants O
of O
the O
Visigoths I-MISC
, O
and O
somebody O
derives O
the O
name O
from O
caas O
( O
dog O
) O
and O
Goth I-MISC
. O

But O
opposed O
to O
this O
etymology O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
word O
" O
cagot O
" O
is O
first O
found O
in O
this O
form O
no O
earlier O
than O
1551 O
. O

French I-MISC
historian O
Pierre I-PER
de I-PER
Marca I-PER
( O
16th O
century O
) O
, O
in O
his O
Histoire I-MISC
de I-MISC
Beam I-MISC
, O
holds O
that O
the O
word O
signifies O
hunters O
of O
the O
Goths I-MISC
, O
and O
that O
the O
Cagots I-MISC
are O
descendants O
of O
the O
Saracens I-MISC
. O

Others O
made O
them O
descendants O
of O
the O
Albigenses I-MISC
. O

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians I-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O
lepers O
were O
known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O
, O
and O
that O
, O
Goths I-MISC
or O
not O
, O
these O
Cagots I-MISC
were O
affected O
in O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
with O
a O
particular O
form O
of O
leprosy O
or O
a O
condition O
resembling O
it O
. O

Thus O
would O
arise O
the O
confusion O
between O
Christians I-MISC
and O
Cretins I-MISC
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
the O
French I-MISC
Revolution I-MISC
that O
any O
steps O
were O
taken O
to O
ameliorate O
their O
lot O
, O
but O
today O
they O
no O
longer O
form O
a O
class O
and O
have O
been O
practically O
lost O
sight O
of O
in O
the O
general O
peasantry O

After O
leaving O
French I-LOC
Sudan I-LOC
in O
January O
1899 O
, O
they O
ruthlessly O
subjected O
the O
native O
peoples O
, O
meeting O
little O
resistance O
. O

One O
of O
the O
few O
to O
resist O
was O
the O
sorcerer O
queen O
Sarraounia I-PER
, O
ruler O
of O
the O
Azna I-MISC
, O
a O
pagan O
people O
in O
a O
long O
Islamized I-MISC
region O
. O

Determinated O
to O
bar O
the O
expedition O
's O
road O
, O
Sarraounia I-PER
wrote O
to O
Voulet I-PER
a O
provocative O
letter O
full O
of O
insults O
; O
the O
French I-MISC
took O
up O
the O
challenge O
, O
and O
on O
April O
15 O
left O
the O
camp O
marching O
towards O
the O
villages O
of O
Lougou I-LOC
and O
Tougana I-LOC
, O
where O
Sarraounia I-PER
had O
concentrated O
her O
forces O
. O

The O
day O
after O
, O
at O
6:00 O
, O
started O
what O
Lt O
. O

Paul I-PER
Joalland I-PER
called O
" O
one O
of O
the O
hottest O
moment O
of O
the O
campaign O
" O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
found O
the O
enemy O
assembled O
on O
the O
field O
, O
while O
women O
and O
children O
had O
already O
retired O
themselves O
in O
a O
small O
thick O
and O
almost O
impenetrable O
bush O
where O
the O
Azna I-MISC
defended O
themselves O
when O
facing O
a O
superior O
enemy O
. O

After O
the O
Azna I-MISC
had O
started O
to O
sisperse O
under O
the O
French I-MISC
gunfire O
, O
their O
lines O
broke O
when O
hit O
by O
three O
grapeshot O
balls O
; O
the O
Azna I-MISC
then O
retreated O
in O
the O
bush O
, O
where O
the O
thick O
foliage O
partly O
protected O
the O
natives O
from O
the O
gunfire O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
felt O
that O
if O
left O
there O
, O
the O
Azna I-MISC
may O
attack O
them O
at O
night O
; O
so O
it O
was O
decideed O
to O
assault O
the O
bush O
, O
but O
being O
careful O
to O
leave O
a O
way O
of O
escape O
for O
the O
Azna I-MISC
open O
, O
so O
to O
avoid O
a O
too O
deadly O
confrontation O
that O
could O
cost O
too O
much O
blood O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
met O
a O
strong O
resistance O
, O
killing O
2 O
riflemen O
and O
wounding O
4 O
, O
but O
were O
at O
the O
end O
successful O
and O
forced O
the O
Azna I-MISC
to O
escape O
. O

The O
battle O
had O
protracted O
itself O
till O
13:00 O
, O
and O
among O
the O
French I-MISC
tirailleurs O
4 O
were O
killed O
and O
6 O
wounded O
, O
with O
7,000 O
cartridges O
consummed O
. O

The O
capture O
gun O
, O
also O
called O
a O
dart O
gun O
, O
is O
an O
invention O
which O
was O
refined O
by O
a O
team O
headed O
by O
Dr O
Tony I-PER
Pooley I-PER
and O
Dr O
Toni I-PER
Harthoorn I-PER
in O
Kenya I-LOC
in O
the O
early O
1960 O
's O
. O

Since O
then O
it O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O
capture O
of O
large O
and O
medium-sized O
animals O
to O
transport O
them O
safely O
. O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
barbiturate O
and O
/ O
or O
other O
drugs O
, O
backed O
by O
a O
ball O
bearing O
which O
was O
separated O
from O
the O
drug O
mix O
with O
a O
wadding O
. O

On O
impact O
with O
the O
animal O
the O
inertial O
momentum O
of O
the O
balls O
injects O
the O
drug O
into O
the O
animal O
, O
causing O
torpor O
and O
prostration O
within O
minutes O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O
drugs O
the O
handlers O
then O
have O
to O
move O
quickly O
to O
secure O
the O
animal O
for O
transport O
, O
monitor O
its O
vital O
signs O
, O
protect O
its O
eyes O
and O
ears O
, O
and O
then O
inject O
reversing O
drugs O
when O
needed O
. O

Many O
large O
animals O
are O
acutely O
sensitive O
to O
stress O
and O
can O
easily O
die O
without O
careful O
treatment O
. O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O
Dr O
Harthoorn I-PER
's O
team O
was O
that O
different O
species O
, O
despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O
example O
the O
rhinoceros O
and O
the O
buffalo O
) O
needed O
very O
different O
doses O
and O
spectra O
of O
drugs O
to O
safely O
immobilise O
them O
. O

In O
some O
species O
the O
margin O
of O
error O
is O
very O
small O
indeed O
. O

Modern O
capture O
guns O
are O
gas-fired O
and O
collapsible O

Several O
models O
are O

( O

, O
in O
his O
Histoire I-MISC

radio_beam I-MISC
, O
holds O
that O
the O

signifies O
hunters O
of O
the O
Goths I-MISC
, O
and O
that O
the O
Cagots I-MISC
are O
descendants O

Others O
make O
them O
descendants O
of O
the O
Albigenses I-MISC

A O
far O
more O
probable O
explanation O
of O
their O
name O
Christians I-MISC
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
medieval O
times O
all O

known O
as O
pauperes O
Christi O

that O
, O
Goths I-MISC

these O

the O
Middle O
Ages O
with O
a O
particular O
form O
of O

Thus O
would O
originate O
the O
confusion O

It O

The O
French I-MISC
found O
the O

assemble O
on O

while O

had O
already O

themselves O
in O

almost O
impenetrable O

the O

After O

The O
French I-MISC
felt O
that O
if O

the O
Azna I-MISC
may O
attack O

so O
it O

to O
leave O
a O
way O

Dr O
Toni I-PER
Harthoorn I-PER
in O
Kenya I-LOC
in O
the O
early O

. O

Since O
then O
it O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O

One O
major O

in O
January O
1899 O
, O
they O
ruthlessly O
subjected O
the O
native O
peoples O
, O
meeting O
little O
resistance O
. O

One O
of O
the O
few O
to O
defy O
was O
the O
sorcerer O
queen O
Sarraounia I-PER
, O
ruler O
of O
the O
Azna I-MISC
, O
a O
pagan O
people O
in O
a O
long O
Islamized I-MISC
region O
. O

Determinated O
to O
bar O
the O
expedition O
's O
road O
, O
Sarraounia I-PER
wrote O
to O
Voulet I-PER
a O
provocative O
letter O
full O
of O
insults O
; O
the O
French I-MISC
took O
up O
the O
challenge O
, O
and O
on O
April O
fifteen O
left O
the O
camp O
march O
towards O
the O
villages O
of O
Lougou I-LOC

where O
Sarraounia I-PER
had O
concentrated O
her O
force O

The O
day O
after O
, O
astatine O
6:00 O
, O
started O
what O
Lt O

Paul I-PER
Joalland I-PER
called O
" O
one O
of O
the O
hottest O
moment O
of O
the O
campaign O
" O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
found O
the O
enemy O
assembled O
on O
the O
field O
, O
while O
woman O
and O
children O
had O
already O
retired O
themselves O
in O
a O
small O
thick O
and O
almost O
impenetrable O
bush O
where O
the O
Azna I-MISC
defend O
themselves O
when O
facing O
a O
superior O
enemy O
. O

After O
the O
Azna I-MISC
had O
started O
to O
sisperse O
under O
the O
French I-MISC
gunfire O
, O
their O
lines O
broke O
when O
hit O
by O
three O
grapeshot O
ball O
; O
the O
Azna I-MISC
then O
retreated O
in O
the O
bush O
, O
where O
the O
thick O
foliage O
partly O
protect O
the O
natives O
from O
the O
gunfire O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
felt O
that O
if O
left O
there O
, O
the O
Azna I-MISC
may O
attack O
them O
at O
night O
; O
sol O
it O
Washington O
decideed O
to O
assault O
the O
bush O
, O
but O
being O
careful O
to O
leave O
angstrom O
way O
of O
escape O
for O
the O
Azna I-MISC
open O
, O
so O
to O
avoid O
a O
too O
deadly O
confrontation O
that O
could O
cost O
too O
much O
blood O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
met O
angstrom O
strong O
resistance O
, O
killing O
2 O
riflemen O
and O
wounding O
4 O
, O
merely O
were O
at O
the O
end O
successful O
and O
forced O
the O
Azna I-MISC
to O
escape O
. O

The O
battle O
have O
protracted O
itself O
till O
13:00 O
, O
and O
among O
the O
French I-MISC
tirailleurs O
4 O
were O
kill O
and O
6 O
wounded O

with O
7,000 O
cartridges O
consummed O

The O
capture O
gun O
, O
also O
called O
angstrom O
dart O
gun O
, O
is O
an O
invention O
which O
was O
refined O
by O
a O
team O
headed O
by O
Dr O
Tony I-PER
Pooley I-PER
and O
Dr O
Toni I-PER
Harthoorn I-PER
in O
Kenya I-LOC
in O
the O
early O
1960 O
's O
. O

Since O
then O
it O
hour_angle O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O
capture O
of O
large O
and O
medium-sized O
animals O
to O
conveyance O
them O
safely O
. O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
angstrom O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
be O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O
with O
a O
dose O
of O
barbiturate O
and O
/ O
or O
other O
drugs O
, O
backed O
by O
a O
ball O
bearing O
which O
Washington O
separated O
from O
the O
drug O
mix O
with O
angstrom O
packing_material O
. O

On O
impact O
with O
the O
animal O
the O
inertial O
momentum O
of O
the O
ball O
injects O
the O
drug O
into O
the O
animal O
, O
causing O
torpor O
and O
prostration O
within O
minutes O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
power O
of O
the O
drugs O
the O
handlers O
then O
have O
to O
move O
quickly O
to O
secure O
the O
animal O
for O
conveyance O
, O
monitor O
its O
vital O
signs O
, O
protect O
its O
eyes O
and O
ears O
, O
and O
then O
inject O
reversing O
drugs O
when O
needed O
. O

Many O
large O
animals O
are O
acutely O
sensitive O
to O
stress O
and O
can O
easily O
die O
without O
careful O
treatment O
. O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O
Dr O
Harthoorn I-PER
's O
team O
was O
that O
different O
species O
, O
despite O
being O
of O
approximately O
equal O
size O
( O
for O
example O
the O
rhinoceros O
and O
the O
American_bison O
) O
needed O
very O
different O
doses O
and O
spectra O
of O
drugs O
to O
safely O
immobilize O
them O
. O

In O
some O
species O
the O
margin O
of O
mistake O
is O
very O
small O
indeed O
. O

Modern O
capture O
gun O
are O
gas-fired O
and O
collapsible O
. O

several O
model O
are O
available O
