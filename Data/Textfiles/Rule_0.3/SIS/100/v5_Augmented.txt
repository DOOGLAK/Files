features O
four O
red O

, O
located O
at O

However O
, O
unlike O
the O
Beatmania I-MISC

IIDX I-MISC
) O
, O
depending O
on O
the O

in O
the O

" O
, O
where O
each O
player O
need O
to O
control O
2 O

Essentially O
this O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
7 O
key O
mode O
of O
beatmania O
IIDX I-MISC
, O
but O
due O
to O
the O
location O
of O
these O

--- O
located O
in O
a O

of O
the O

, O
right O
underneath O
the O

and O
away O
from O

--- O
it O
makes O
it O
even O
more O
difficult O
than O

IIDX I-MISC
in O
some O
occasion O
( O
especially O
since O

becoming O
the O

in O

. O

The O
pedal O
is O
used O
in O
all O
gameplay O
and O
treated O
as O
a O
gameplay O

But O
, O
