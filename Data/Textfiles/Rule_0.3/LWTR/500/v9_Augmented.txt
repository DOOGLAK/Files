However O
, O

this O

very O

describes O
itself O

It O
is O
not O

The O

like O

The O

distinctive O

for O

The O
League I-ORG
describes O
itself O
as O
being O
based O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
Christianity I-MISC

is O
vehement O
in O
its O
anti-communism O

They O
argue O
in O
favour O
of O
capitalism O
by O
promoting O
the O
sanctity O
of O
private O
property O

individual O
enterprise O

They O

keen O
promoters O

They O
are O
strongly O
monarchist O
