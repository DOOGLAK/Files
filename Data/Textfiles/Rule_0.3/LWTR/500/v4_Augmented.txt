They O
added O
that O
the O
crustaceans O
included O
two O

two O

indicating O
that O
this O

help O

was O
first O
discovered O

According O
to O
Professor O
Amos I-PER

of O
the O
Hebrew I-ORG

, O
the O
cave O
is O
unique O
in O

a O
thick O
layer O

chalk O
left O
it O

The O
cave O

remain O
closed O

the O

As O
the O
cave O
was O
completely O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
environment O
, O
it O
sustained O
an O
independent O
ecosystem O

this O
ecosystem O
did O
not O
rely O
on O
sunlight O

photosynthesis O
, O
or O
on O
organic O
compounds O

for O
an O
energy O

Rather O
, O
energy O
was O
extracted O
by O
Chemoautotrophic O
bacteria O
, O
living O
in O
a O
film O
on O

of O

These O

produce O

the O

Its O

and O
often O
critically O
praised O

Nevertheless O
the O
network O
struggled O
, O
and O
ultimately O
failed O
, O
largely O
because O
of O
the O
reluctance O
of O
many O

CBS I-ORG

competing O
for O

relatively O
small O

while O
other O
networks O
coming O
on O
line O
at O
the O
same O
time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
promised O
larger O
and O
more O
broad-based O
viewership O
and O
therefore O
got O
cable O
operators O
to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O
. O

MTV I-ORG
and O
ESPN I-ORG
thrived O
and O
gave O
rise O
to O
additional O

channels O
within O
a O
short O
time O
, O
while O

folded O

However O
, O
unlike O

, O
where O

Essentially O
this O

very O
similar O
to O
the O

but O
due O

--- O
it O
makes O
