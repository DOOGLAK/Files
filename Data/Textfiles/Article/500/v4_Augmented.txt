Nevertheless O
the O

Sarraounia I-PER

Paul I-PER

called O
" O
one O
of O
the O

moment O

campaign O
" O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
found O
the O
enemy O
assembled O
on O
the O
field O
, O
while O
women O
and O
children O
had O
already O
retired O
themselves O
in O
a O
small O
thick O
and O
almost O
impenetrable O
bush O
where O
the O
Azna I-MISC
defended O
themselves O
when O
facing O

After O

under O
the O
French I-MISC

, O
their O
lines O
broke O
when O
hit O
by O
three O
grapeshot O
balls O
; O
the O
Azna I-MISC
then O
retreated O
in O
the O
bush O
, O
where O
the O
thick O
foliage O
partly O
protected O
the O
natives O
from O
the O
gunfire O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
felt O
that O
if O
left O
there O
, O
the O
Azna I-MISC
may O
attack O
them O
at O
night O
; O
so O
it O
was O
decideed O
to O
assault O
the O
bush O
, O
but O
being O
careful O
to O
leave O
a O
way O
of O
escape O
for O
the O
Azna I-MISC
open O
, O
so O
to O
avoid O
a O
too O
deadly O
confrontation O
that O
could O
cost O
too O
much O
blood O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
met O
a O
strong O
resistance O
, O
killing O
2 O
riflemen O
and O
wounding O
4 O
, O
but O
were O
at O
the O
end O
successful O
and O
forced O
the O
Azna I-MISC
to O
escape O

The O
battle O
had O
protracted O
itself O

13:00 O
