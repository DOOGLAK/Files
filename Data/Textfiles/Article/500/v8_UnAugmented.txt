a O

often O
critically O

Nevertheless O
the O

struggled O

largely O
because O

the O
reluctance O

many O

other O

coming O

the O

time O
such O
as O
MTV I-ORG

promised O
larger O

more O
broad-based O
viewership O

therefore O
got O
cable O

to O
carry O
them O
far O
more O
easily O

MTV I-ORG

The O
origin O

It O
has O

opposed O

The O

Dr O

Harthoorn I-PER
in O
Kenya I-LOC
in O
the O
early O

. O

Since O
then O
it O
has O
become O
the O
standard O
tool O
for O
capture O
of O
large O
and O
medium-sized O
animals O
to O
transport O
them O
safely O
. O

The O
original O
piston-operated O
medium-bore O
gun O
fired O
a O
tranquilizer O
dart O
which O
is O
a O
syringe O
which O
was O
loaded O

a O
dose O

other O

On O

the O
animal O
the O
inertial O
momentum O
of O
the O
balls O
injects O
the O
drug O

the O
animal O

causing O
torpor O

prostration O
within O
minutes O

Because O
of O
the O
power O

the O

the O

then O
have O

One O
major O
discovery O
by O

was O
that O
different O

despite O
being O
of O
roughly O
equal O
size O
( O
for O

the O
rhinoceros O

the O

needed O
very O
different O
doses O

spectra O

to O
safely O
immobilise O
them O

species O
the O
