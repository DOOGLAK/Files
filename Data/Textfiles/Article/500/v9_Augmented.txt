all O

added O
that O

two O

two O

indicating O
that O
this O

was O
first O
discovered O
when O
a O

was O
discerned O
in O
a O

near O

According O
to O
Professor O
Amos I-PER
Frumkin I-PER
of O
the O
Hebrew I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
the O
cave O
is O
unique O
in O
that O
a O
thick O
layer O
of O
chalk O
left O
it O
impermeable O
to O

The O
cave O
will O
remain O
closed O
to O
the O
public O
to O
allow O
scientific O
investigation O

. O

As O
the O
cave O
was O
completely O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
environment O
, O
it O
sustained O
an O
independent O
ecosystem O

this O

did O
not O
rely O
on O

, O
or O
on O

for O
an O

Rather O
, O

was O

by O
Chemoautotrophic O
bacteria O
, O
living O
in O
a O
film O
on O

in O
the O

theory O
of O
Social O
Credit O
expounded O
by O
C. I-PER
H. I-PER
Douglas I-PER
. O

It O
describes O
itself O
as O
upholding O
the O
virtues O
of O
freedom O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
political O
party O
, O
but O
rather O
sees O
itself O
as O
a O
watchdog O
against O

. O

The O
League I-ORG
was O
formed O
in O
1960 O
by O
a O
merger O
of O
various O
Leagues O
of O
Rights O
based O
in O
the O
Australian I-MISC
states O

the O
first O
of O
which O
was O

The O
League I-ORG
, O
like O
many O

far-Right O
organisations O
, O
strongly O
denies O
that O
the O
Holocaust I-MISC

which O
millions O

people O
, O
particularly O
European I-MISC
Jews I-MISC

strongly O

They O
believe O
that O
the O
world O
is O
run O
by O
a O
secret O
society O
of O
Jews I-MISC

The O
League I-ORG
is O
distinctive O
for O
asserting O
that O
The I-MISC
Protocols I-MISC

the I-MISC
Elders I-MISC
of I-MISC
Zion I-MISC
is O
a O
genuine O
Jewish I-MISC
document O

the O
Encyclopædi I-MISC

the O
Protocols I-MISC

a O
" O

as O
a O
pretext O
and O
rationale O
for O
anti-Semitism O
in O
the O
early O
20th O
century O
" O
) O
. O

The O
League I-ORG
describes O
itself O
as O
being O
based O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
Christianity I-MISC
and O
is O
vehement O
in O
its O
anti-communism O
. O

They O
argue O
in O
favour O
of O
capitalism O
by O
promoting O
the O
sanctity O
of O
private O
property O
and O
individual O
enterprise O

They O

keen O

They O
are O
strongly O
monarchist O
