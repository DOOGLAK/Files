The O
Ayalon I-LOC
Cave I-LOC
is O
a O
large O
underground O
limestone O
cave O
located O
near O
Ramla I-LOC
, O
Israel I-LOC
. O

The O
cave O
, O
300 O
feet O
deep O
, O
with O
its O
branch O
extends O
almost O
2.5 O
kilometres O
making O
it O
the O
second O
largest O
limestone O
cave O
in O
Israel I-LOC
. O

Researchers O
announced O
that O
they O
have O
so O
far O
discovered O
eight O
new O
species O
, O
all O
without O
eyes O
, O
including O
four O
crustacean O
species O
and O
four O
terrestrial O
species O
, O
previously O
unknown O
to O
science O
. O

They O
added O
that O
the O
crustaceans O
included O
two O
saltwater O
species O
and O
two O
freshwater O
species O
, O
indicating O
that O
this O
diversity O
might O
help O
better O
understand O
the O
water O
history O
of O
the O
region O
. O

The O
cave O
was O
first O
discovered O
when O
a O
small O
opening O
was O
discerned O
in O
a O
quarry O
near O
Ramla I-LOC
. O

According O
to O
Professor O
Amos I-PER
Frumkin I-PER
of O
the O
Hebrew I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
the O
cave O
is O
unique O
in O
that O
a O
thick O
layer O
of O
chalk O
left O
it O
impermeable O
to O
water O
. O

The O
cave O
will O
remain O
closed O
to O
the O
public O
to O
allow O
scientific O
investigation O
to O
continue O
undisturbed O
. O

As O
the O
cave O
was O
completely O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
environment O
, O
it O
sustained O
an O
independent O
ecosystem O
; O
this O
ecosystem O
did O
not O
rely O
on O
sunlight O
and O
photosynthesis O
, O
or O
on O
organic O
compounds O
, O
for O
an O
energy O
source O
. O

Rather O
, O
energy O
was O
extracted O
by O
Chemoautotrophic O
bacteria O
, O
living O
in O
a O
film O
on O
top O
of O
the O
pool O
water O
. O

These O
bacteria O
produce O
energy O
by O
oxidizing O
the O
sulfide O
compounds O
in O
the O
water O
, O
and O
derive O
organic O
compounds O
using O
carbon O

from O
the O
air O
. O

These O
compounds O

the O
field O
, O
while O
women O
and O
children O
had O
already O
retired O
themselves O
in O
a O
small O
thick O
and O
almost O
impenetrable O
bush O
where O
the O
Azna I-MISC
defended O
themselves O
when O
facing O
a O
superior O
enemy O
. O

After O
the O
Azna I-MISC
had O
started O
to O
sisperse O
under O
the O
French I-MISC
gunfire O
, O
their O
lines O
broke O
when O
hit O
by O
three O
grapeshot O
balls O
; O
the O
Azna I-MISC
then O
retreated O
in O
the O
bush O
, O
where O
the O
thick O
foliage O
partly O
protected O
the O
natives O
from O
the O
gunfire O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
felt O
that O
if O
left O
there O
, O
the O
Azna I-MISC
may O
attack O
them O
at O
night O
; O
so O
it O
was O
decideed O
to O
assault O
the O
bush O
, O
but O
being O
careful O
to O
leave O
a O
way O
of O
escape O
for O
the O
Azna I-MISC
open O
, O
so O
to O
avoid O
a O
too O
deadly O
confrontation O
that O
could O
cost O
too O
much O
blood O
. O

The O
French I-MISC
met O
a O
strong O
resistance O
, O
killing O
2 O
riflemen O
and O
wounding O
4 O
, O
but O
were O
at O
the O
end O
successful O
and O
forced O
the O
Azna I-MISC
to O
escape O
. O

The O
battle O
had O
protracted O
itself O
till O
13:00 O
, O
and O
among O
the O
French I-MISC
tirailleurs O
4 O
were O
killed O
and O
6 O
wounded O
, O
with O
7,000 O
cartridges O
consummed O
