became O
the O

be O
a O
less O

, O
having O

Her O
association O
with O
Germaine I-PER
de I-PER
Staë I-PER
was O
obviously O
of O
the O
greatest O
importance O
, O
since O

Fearing O
a O

they O
convened O
a O

separate O
counsels O

At O
the O
hearing O
, O
family O
members O
, O
including O
Carder I-PER

husband O
, O
opposed O
the O
C-section O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
she O
would O
be O
unlikely O
to O

it O
and O
that O

would O
not O

opposed O
the O

However O
, O
a O
neonatologist O

personally O

testified O
that O
the O

would O
have O
at O
least O
a O
60% O
chance O

survival O
-- O
nearly O
that O
of O
a O

Carder I-PER

own O
long-term O
oncologist O
