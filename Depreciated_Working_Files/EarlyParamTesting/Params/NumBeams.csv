1,"The 139th was formed at Camp Howe , near Pittsburgh , on September 1 , 1862 . Frederick H. Collier was the first colonel . After burying the dead on the field of Second Battle of Bull Run , the regiment was attached to Howe 's Brigade of Couch 's Division of the IV Corps of the Army of the Potomac where it replaced De Trobriand 's 55th New York , Gardes Lafayette regiment on September 11 , 1862 . The composition of this brigade remained unchanged from this point until the war 's end and included the 62d NY , 93d PVI , 98th PVI and the 102d PVI . During this time Couch 's Division was detached from the Army and was occupied with guarding the fords on the Potomac . The 139th along with its brigade and division spent the next week marching from Poolesville to Sandy Hook , Maryland from where on September 17 , 1862 , it was forced marched to the Battle of Antietam where it was placed in line of battle but did not see any significant combat . The next day , the regiment pursued the Confederate army and fought in a skirmish at Williamsport . The 139th was transferred in October 1862 to the VI Corps . In the Battle of Fredericksburg , it suffered minor casualties from artillery fire , but did n't get a chance to fight . Five months later , however , it did participate in the 2nd Battle of Fredericksburg . At the Battle of Gettysburg in July , it helped defend the left flank of the Union army . Throughout the spring and into early summer of 1864 , the 139th fought in Grant 's Overland Campaign and the early stages of the Siege of Petersburg . In July , it was transferred to Washington , D.C. with the rest of the VI Corps to defeat Lt. Gen. Jubal Early 's attack on the city . Then they fought under Philip Sheridan in the Valley to ensure that no more Confederate armies would invade again . ( See the article on the campaign ) . By December 1864 , they were back in the siege lines of Petersburg . The 139th supported Sheridan in the Appomattox Campaign and fought in the Battle of Sayler 's Creek . After the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse , it was ordered to the North Carolina border to support William T. Sherman , but the Confederate surrender there made further support unnecessary . The regiment was mustered out June 21 , 1865 .",O I-ORG O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O I-LOC O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O I-LOC O O I-ORG O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG O O I-PER I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O I-LOC O O O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC O O I-ORG O I-PER O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,S,E,E,,E,0,24,24
2,"The 1896 Atlantic City rail crash occurred shortly after 6:30 pm on July 30 , 1896 at a crossing just west of Atlantic City , New Jersey , crushing five loaded passenger coaches , killing 50 and seriously injuring approximately 60 . A train consisting of seven cars left Atlantic City over the West Jersey Railroad bearing a special excursion of Red Men and their friends from Bridgeton and Salem , New Jersey , and had reached the crossing of the Reading Railroad when it was struck by the 5:40 down express train from Philadelphia . Two cars were demolished and the two following cars were telescoped . The engine of the Reading train was wrecked , the engineer killed , and the fireman fatally injured . The car behind it was thrown from the track and many of its occupants were killed or injured . In 1896 , leaving Atlantic City , the tracks of the West Jersey Road ran parallel to those of the Camden and Atlantic until they crossed the drawbridge , when they switched off to the south , crossing the Reading Road at an oblique angle . John Greiner , the engineer of the West Jersey train , saw the Reading train approaching the crossing at a swift speed , but as the signals were open for him to proceed on his way , he continued . His engine had barely cleared the crossing when the locomotive of the Reading train , which left Philadelphia at 5:40 pm , struck the first car full in the centre , throwing it far off the track in a nearby ditch , and completely submerging it . The second car of the West Jersey train was also carried into the ditch , the third and fourth cars being telescoped . The engine of the Reading train was thrown to the other side of the track , carrying with it the first coach . A few minutes after the collision , the boiler of the Reading locomotive exploded , scalding several to death and casting boiling spray over many of the injured passengers . As soon as the news reached Atlantic City it spread rapidly , and thousands of people flocked to the scene . The road leading to the collision was a constant scene of hackney carriages , omnibuses , bicycles , and all kinds of vehicles , while thousands of pedestrians hurried along the path to render what assistance they could or to satisfy their curiosity . Darkness fell quickly , and the work of rescuing the injured and recovering the bodies of the dead was carried out under the glare of huge bonfires . As onlookers watched through the night , the mangled and burned bodies of the dead were carried from the wreckage which trapped them and laid side by side on the gravel bank near the track , with no other covering than the few newspapers gathered from the passengers . The wounded were quickly gathered together and carried by train and wagon to the Atlantic City Hospital , where six of them died shortly after their arrival . Two others died within a day , with 42 having been killed at the collision scene . The old Excursion House at the foot of Mississippi Avenue was converted into a morgue , and the dead were taken there . During the first night after the crash , the streets in the vicinity of the Excursion House and the City Hospital , as well as the road leading to the scene of the accident , were packed with people anxious to learn the latest news . The Bridgeton and Salem excursionists who escaped injury were brought back to Atlantic City and sent home on a special train several hours later in the evening . James W. Hoyt , Secretary of the New Jersey Department of Public Safety , immediately upon learning of the extent of the accident , telegraphed for the Philadelphia Medical Emergency Corps , fifteen of whom responded , and hurried to Atlantic City on a special train which left Philadelphia at 10:45 pm . These surgeons materially aided Atlantic City 's volunteer corps , which was composed of almost every physician then living in the city . Many of the injured were taken to hotels , as the city hospitals soon became overcrowded . About thirty of the wounded had their injuries dressed and were able to proceed on their way . The wife of Edward Farr , the Reading engineer who died while on the job , and was found with one hand on the throttle and the other on the brake , when informed of the accident and of her husband 's death , was unable to withstand the shock , and fell to the floor dead . County Coroner William McLaughlin , immediately upon hearing of the accident , went to the scene . He went directly into the block tower and questioned operator George F. Hauser. Houser told him that he thought the excursion train had time to cross the tracks of the Reading before the express got there and he set the "" clear "" signal for the West Jersey train . ( The signalling system worked as follows : the interlocking block system was used . There were three poles with semaphores controlled by the tower on the reading tracks and two on the West Jersey . The pole furthest from the tower on the Reading tracks was distant about 2,000 yards . The other two were much closer . When the operator set the "" clear "" signal on the Pennsylvania track , this would automatically set the "" danger "" signal on the Reading track , and vice versa . ) Before Hauser could make a further explanation to the coroner he received an order from the railroad officials to say nothing . He obeyed , and made no further explanation . Pending an investigation , Hauser was put under arrest by the coroner , but was released on $500 bond . A jury was impanelled the following day . Testimony on August 4 appeared to implicate the dead Reading Railroad express engineer , Edward Farr . His action in running at a speed of forty-five miles an hour past a danger signal seemed inexplicable to those present at the inquest . His reputation was that of an experienced engineer and a man of exceptionally high moral character , and not of a reckless or careless disposition . Only two weeks previous to the accident his train was signalled to stop at that very crossing , and he promptly brought his train under control . The coroner 's jury returned verdicts on August 7 . Six jurors merely stated the manner of the passengers ' deaths . Three found that "" Engineer Edward D . Farr of the Atlantic City Railroad failed for have his engine under proper control on approaching [ the ] crossing , and that Tower Man George F. Hauser , in giving the excursion train of the West Jersey Railroad the right of way over a fast express used bad judgment. .. [ and ] that Engineer John Greiner of said excursion train erred in not exercising greater care on crossing ahead of said fast express . "" Three others found that "" the cause of the collision was the failure of Edward Farr , engineer of Train No. 23 , to give heed in time to the semaphore signals and crossing under the rules. .. the tower man , George F. Hauser , may have used poor judgment in his estimate of the distance away of the Atlantic City Railroad train when he gave the white boards to the West Jersey and Seashore Excursion Train No . 700 .

4,"30 Seconds to Mars ( or Thirty Seconds to Mars ) is an alternative rock band from Los Angeles , California , featuring Jared Leto , Shannon Leto , Tomo Milicevic . Created in 1998 by Jared Leto and his brother , Shannon , 30 Seconds to Mars began as a small family project . Things began to speed up quickly , and Matt Wachter later joined the band as bassist and keyboard player . After working with small revolving door of guitarists ( as the band 's first two guitarists , Kevin Drake and Solon Bixler , left the band due to issues primarily related to touring ) , the three auditioned Tomo Miličević to round out the band 's roster . According to an interview from Virgin Records , the band 's name 30 Seconds to Mars ' first , self-titled album , produced by Bob Ezrin , was released in 2002 to mixed reviews and achieved sales of just over 100,000 . Their sophomore album , A Beautiful Lie , was released on August 30 , 2005 . For this effort , the band traveled ( during the course of three years ) to four continents , to perfect their sound and also to allow for Jared 's film career . The album was produced by Josh Abraham , whose producing credits also include Orgy , Velvet Revolver , and Linkin Park . Because A Beautiful Lie was leaked five months before its release , the band decided to include two bonus tracks : "" Battle of One "" ( an original song that was also set to be the album 's title track when it was first announced ) and "" Hunter "" ( a cover of the Björkband song ) . To further promote the album , the band also enclosed "" golden tickets "" in 12 copies , which granted their owners access to any 30 Seconds to Mars concert free of charge , along with backstage access . On August 31 , 2006 , the band won the MTV2 Award for "" The Kill "" at the MTV Video Music Awards , one of their two nominations . The second nomination was for Best Rock Video ; however , they lost to AFI 's "" Miss Murder "" . In the video members of the band reenact scenes from The Shining . A Beautiful Lie was certified platinum by the RIAA in January for distribution of over 1,000,000 albums . In October , the band began their "" Welcome to the Universe "" tour , sponsored by MTV2 . They were supported on this tour by Head Automatica , The Receiving End of Sirens , Cobra Starship , and several other bands including Street Drum Corps . The tour was "" environmentally sound "" according to a 2006 interview with then-bassist Matt Wachter . "" Jared and Shannon put together this thing called Environmentor which is illustrating ways --- alternatives --- to kind of clean up some of the mess we leave behind . We fueled the bus with vegetable oil , "" he explains . On November 20 , MTV2 premiered the video for "" From Yesterday "" ; the video is the first American rock video ever shot in its entirety in the People 's Republic of China . The music video is loosely based on the film The Last Emperor . On April 29 , 2007 , the band performed at the Australian MTV Australia Video Music Awards , where they were nominated for three awards , winning "" Best Rock Video "" and "" Video of the Year "" for "" The Kill "" . As of Spring 2007 , the band is supporting The Used as a part of the "" Taste of Chaos "" tour and have scheduled a string of dates in Europe supporting Linkin Park . They are also scheduled to play Roskilde , Rock am Ring , Pinkpop , Give It A Name Festival and Download . Following other commitments , they will begin working on their third album . Following the release of "" From Yesterday "" as a single , the band posted a link on their MySpace blog to vote for the next single from A Beautiful Lie . The choices available were "" A Beautiful Lie "" , "" The Fantasy "" , "" Savior "" , and "" The Story "" . Another vote was done later between the top two songs , "" A Beautiful Lie "" and "" The Fantasy "" . On May 2 , 2007 , the band announced that "" A Beautiful Lie "" had won and would be the next single . On August 8th , 2007 , Kerrang ! announced that 30 Seconds to Mars has been nominated for two categories of the Kerrang ! Awards 2007 - Best International Newcomer and Best Single - The Kill . On August 24th , they had only won the award for ' Best Single , ' which was The Kill . The other award was lost to Madina Lake . On November 1 , 2007 , the band won the MTV Europe Music Award for "" Rock Out "" , one of the two catorgories they were nominated in . On December 21st , 2007 , 30 Seconds to Mars won Fuse 's Best of 2007 Award . They beat out Korn and had amassed over 7 million votes . 31 other bands and artists such as Justin Timberlake , Gwen Stefani , Linkin Park and Avenged Sevenfold were also included in the contest . The band 's phoenix logo ( which the band named "" Mithra "" ) bears the phrase "" Provehito in Altum "" , the band 's motto . Roughly translated from Latin , this means "" Launch forth into the deep "" ; but a more stylized version would be "" Rocket in ( to ) High ( ness ) "" . The logo was primarily used for promotion of the band 's debut , whereas for A Beautiful Lie , the new Trinity logo was created consisting of three skulls , along with the band 's name and motto . The Echelon is a publicity street team for the band 30 Seconds to Mars , which helps in bringing friends to the shows , phoning local radio stations to request the band 's songs , putting up posters , posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online , and maintaining magazines or websites dedicated to the band . It is also the name of one of their songs in the album 30 Seconds to Mars . The band made acoustic versions of songs from their second album A Beautiful Lie . Some of the acoustics have been included in some versions of the album , e.g. Was it a Dream ? ( Acoustic ) . In addition to the tracks on their two full-length releases thus far , the band has also recorded a few other tracks . Among these tracks are "" Phase 1 : Fortification "" and "" Valhalla "" , the latter of which was present on an early demo . "" Phase 1 : Fortification "" was released on an overseas single for "" Capricorn ( A Brand New Name ) "" . Another track featured on certain imported 30 Seconds to Mars titles is "" Anarchy in Tokyo "" , a song that was recorded during the process of their self-titled debut . "" Revolution "" was also recorded for the self-titled album , but was n't included because it did n't fit the theme of the album , and because of fear that listeners would take the lyrics too literally , especially after the September 11 , 2001 attacks . "" Occam 's Razor "" was also recorded , but was never included on any of the band 's releases . As a result , it is considered the most difficult to locate of the five unreleased tracks . Demo versions of songs on the band 's self-titled debut were also slightly different , along with different names . For example , "" Fallen "" was previously called "" Jupiter "" , and "" Year Zero "" was previously called "" Hero "" . Also made available are the demo versions of "" Buddha for Mary "" and "" 93 Million Miles "" ; the latter originally had lyrics referring to the band Deadsy , whose members Dr. Nner and P. Exeter Blue I provided extra instrumentation on several tracks , but the lyrics were changed after the two bands were involved in a small feud .

7,"6PR , known as 882 6PR , commenced broadcasting on October 14 , 1931 . 6PR 's focus is on news , talk and sport , and is Perth 's only commercial talkback radio station . 6PR is owned by Fairfax Media , an Australian media company that owns television and radio businesses throughout Australia . Radio in Australia was just twelve years old when 6PR commenced broadcasting on October 14 , 1931 . 6PR was founded by electrical company Nicholson 's Limited , which ran the station from a studio above its showroom in Barrack Street , Perth . In 1963 the Victorian Broadcasting Network purchased Nicholson 's and sold the electrical division of the organisation to Vox Adeon . The broadcasting business was retained and operated under the name Nicholson 's Broadcasting Service Pty Ltd . The operation moved from Barrack Street to 340 Hay Street just after the purchase by the VBN in 1963 . The 6PR studio remained at 340 Hay Street for 22 years before it was demolished to make way for the expansion of Mercedes College . In 1985 the station relocated to its current premises at 169 Hay Street , East Perth . In the station 's early days there were only four people on the payroll now there are around one hundred . The limited hours of broadcasting 69 years ago have gradually been increased to a 24 hour , seven day a week service . Throughout the sixties 6PR was consistently the top rating station in Perth but lost its dominance in 1972 . The image of the station changed from rock n roll to beautiful music with the "" Gentle On Your Mind "" promotion in 1973 . This boosted 6PR 's ratings to a consistent number two with a number one position on several occasions . In 1977 an agreement was made with the TAB by the station 's owners to broadcast races in conjunction with a personality / sport format . In the early eighties the station commenced a more comprehensive news and current affairs format with the introduction of regular programs by Howard Sattler , Bob Maumill and Graham Mabury , which proved extremely popular with listeners . In 1987 the TAB purchased 6PR to secure the future of race broadcasts in Western Australia and races were broadcast across the station during popular talkback programs . During the early nineties the station 's current affairs / talkback program hosted by Sattler , Maumill , Mabury , Peter Newman , Gary Carvolth and Rob Broadfield achieved considerable success in spite of the ever increasing level of racing broadcasts on the station . In 1994 6PR , in conjunction with the TAB , was able to secure a special narrowcast broadcast license which allowed racing broadcasts to be moved from 6PR to the narrowcast broadcaster called Racing Radio . This move allowed 6PR to serve its two distinct audiences , those who listened purely for a talkback / news / current affairs format and those who listened just for racing information , in a more comprehensive manner . In December 1994 6PR was purchased by its current owner Southern Cross Broadcasting which also owned Melbourne 's number one rating talk station 3AW and television stations in Adelaide , Canberra and other places . During the nineties 6PR continued its dominance in the talk format arena with personalities such as David Christison & Lee Tate , Howard Sattler , Jenny Seaton & Gary Carvolth , Liam Bartlett , Harvey Deegan and Graham Mabury . During the Australian Rules Football Season 882 6PR is Perth 's Football Leader . Each week , Brad Hardie , George Grljusich , Karl Langdon , Graham Dawson , Basil Zempilas Glen Jakovich & Shane Woewodin keep you up-to-date with all things football . The AFL commentary team is composed of Basil Zempilas , Karl Langdon , Glen Jakovich , Shane Woewodin , Graham Dawson , Shane Healy and Brad Hardie . With commentary teams in both Melbourne and Perth , 6PR is able to cover every home and away match for the West Coast Eagles and Fremantle Dockers , while also being able to broadcast matches involving other teams utilising their traveling team based in Melbourne . Matches that are unable to be covered by either commentary team are broadcast on-relay from sister stations 3AW in Melbourne and FIVEaa in Adelaide . The local West Australian Football League is also broadcast via a program on 6PR called Bouncing Around . Peter Vlahos is based in the 6PR Studio while Karl Langdon & Harvey Deegan base themselves at different matches . Peter Vlahos then crosses between the two men as they broadcast parts of their matches & respond to football related talkback calls . Updates of all four WAFL matches are provided & AFL Results are also mentioned . Since the addition of the Perth Glory into the Australian national football ( soccer ) competition ( known then as the National Soccer League ) 6PR has broadcast almost all Home & Away matches , The coverage was led by George Grljusich . When the A-League began in 2005 only home matches were broadcast on 6PR . 6PR stopped broadcasting Perth Glory matches after the 2005/2006 A-League season .

13,"Agnieszka Lipska Baranowska ( 1819 - 1890 ) was a Polish playwright and poet . Born on April 16 , 1819 in Gostkócity near Łęczyca in a Polish szlachta family of Lipscy to Jacob Lipski and Marjania Zaluska , she spent her life in the Prussian partition , including the Grand Duchy of Poznań . She had one brother , Konstanty , who died when she was six . She was married in 1838 to Stanisław Baranowski ( 1806-1843 ) , who was an officer in the Polish forces during the January Uprising . After her husband 's death in 1843 , while she was pregnant with their daughter Stanisława , she became the head of the family at the age of 24 , and took care of their lands in Marszew . She had many friends and colleagues among the Polish writers of the Great Emigration , some of whom visited her manor in Marszew .

14,"Agotes or Cagots were a discriminated minority in the Navarrese Pyrenees , Basque provinces , Bearn , Gascony and also Brittany . They have been also known by other names : Cagots , Gahets , Gafets in France ; Agotes , Gafos in Spain ; and Cacons , Cahets , Caqueux and Caquins in Brittany . The earliest mention of them is in 1288 , when they appear to have been called Christiens or Christianos . During the Middle Ages they were popularly looked upon as cretins , lepers , heretics and even as cannibals . They were shunned and hated ; were allotted separate quarters in towns , called cagoteries , and lived in wretched huts in the country distinct from the villages . Excluded from all political and social rights , they were only allowed to enter a church by a special door , and during the service a rail separated them from the other worshippers . Either they were altogether forbidden to partake of the sacrament , or the Eucharist was handed to them on the end of a stick , while a receptacle for holy water was reserved for their exclusive use . They were compelled to wear a distinctive dress , to which , in some places , was attached the foot of a goose or duck ( whence they were sometimes called Canards ) . And so pestilential was their touch considered that it was a crime for them to walk the common road barefooted . The only trades allowed them were those of butcher and carpenter , and their ordinary occupation was wood-cutting . The origin of Agotes ( or Cagots ) is uncertain . It has been suggested that they were descendants of the Visigoths , and somebody derives the name from caas ( dog ) and Goth . But opposed to this etymology is the fact that the word "" cagot "" is first found in this form no earlier than 1551 . French historian Pierre de Marca ( 16th century ) , in his Histoire de Beam , holds that the word signifies hunters of the Goths , and that the Cagots are descendants of the Saracens . Others made them descendants of the Albigenses . A far more probable explanation of their name Christians is to be found in the fact that in medieval times all lepers were known as pauperes Christi , and that , Goths or not , these Cagots were affected in the Middle Ages with a particular form of leprosy or a condition resembling it . Thus would arise the confusion between Christians and Cretins . It was not until the French Revolution that any steps were taken to ameliorate their lot , but today they no longer form a class and have been practically lost sight of in the general peasantry .",I-MISC O I-MISC O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC I-LOC O I-LOC O I-LOC O O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-LOC O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-LOC O O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-MISC O I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O I-MISC O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-MISC O I-MISC O O O O O O I-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,S,E,E,,,,,

20,"The Amateur Hockey Association of Canada ( AHAC ) was an amateur men 's ice hockey league founded in 1886 , in existence until 1898 . It was the second ice hockey league organized in Canada , after one in Kingston , Ontario started in 1883 . It was organized to provide a longer season to determine the Canadian champion . Prior to its founding the Canadian championship was determined in a tournament in Montreal . The 1893 champion of the league , Montreal Hockey Club was the first winner of the Stanley Cup , being awarded the Cup as the champions of the AHAC and the AHAC was considered the top league of Canada . of various hockey clubs met at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal at the instigation of the Victoria Hockey Club of Montreal . They agreed that the season should run from the 1st of January until the 15th of March . The constitution would be adapted from a lacrosse league constitution . The teams knew each other . Mr . Thomas D . Green of Ottawa had played on the 1883 McGill hockey team . In that age , ice hockey was a very different game compared to today : the AHAC rules stated that there were six skaters on each side . The left wing , centre and right wing were the forwards , like today . The rover would line up behind the centre , with the point and coverpoint following , in an ' I ' formation towards the goaltender . The face offs were at a right angle to today 's practice , the centre men facing inwards from the sides of the rink . The goaltenders used no special equipment . There were no goal nets . The goals were two posts , with no crossbar . An umpire would judge the legality of each score . There were no boards along the sides of the ice , and there were no standard dimensions for a rink , although dimensions were instituted for the positioning of the goal out from the ends of the rink . A match was two halves of thirty minutes ( also to note that in the day , game meant goal by modern definition ) . Sudden-death overtime was also in place , and a match would continue until a goal was scored in the event of a tie after regulation . Players in all positions would normally play the entire 60 minutes . The AHAC operated on two different systems in its lifetime : the challenge system , where a championship team would face a new challenger each week for the championship , and the series system , which corresponds to the regular season found in the NHL today . With the exception of 1888 , the challenge system was exclusively used in the AHAC before the advent of the Stanley Cup , while the series system became the norm in 1893 , the first year the Cup was contested . The first championship team of the AHAC was the Montreal Crystals , having unofficially being declared the champions before the AHAC . The first title change occurred on January 14 , 1887 , when the Montreal Victorias defeated the champions 4-0 . The Victorias would hold the title until the very last challenge game , when the Crystals won 3-2 in their third successive challenge . Because of the Vics ' long run as champions , it was decided to switch to the series system in 1888 . The series system was a success , although a tie atop the standings between the Vics and the Montreal Hockey Club ( Montreal HC ) , and the subsequent scheduling of the tiebreaker game caused much trouble when the game was scheduled at a time when two Victorias players were injured , at the home venue of the Montreal HC . However , teams from outside Montreal incurred huge travelling expenses , which led the AHAC to revert back to the challenge system . In 1893 , the first year since 1888 where the AHAC played under a series system , the Montreal Hockey Club lost their first game against the Ottawa Hockey Club , and proceeded to win their next seven en route to the championship . Lord Stanley announced that his challenge trophy ( later known simply as the Stanley Cup ) for the best amateur hockey team in Canada would be presented to the Montreal Hockey Club on May 15 , 1893 , as initial champion . At the time , the Montreal Hockey Club was in a dispute with its parent organization , the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association ( MAAA ) . The hockey club was adamant about refusing the trophy , while the directors of the MAAA decided to accept the trophy , considering it came from the Governor General of Canada . Thus , the trophy was accepted by the MAAA , but with none of the hockey officials of the hockey club present . After accepting the trophy , the hockey club remained adamant about returning the trophy that was presented to them . In the end , the MAAA investigated into why its hockey club wanted to refuse and return the trophy , even though such an action would damage the reputation of the MAAA . It was believed that the people who were in charge of running their team were , in fact , not representative of the team itself , and when the hockey club asked for a loan of $175 in start-up expenses for the 1894 season , it was flatly refused ( the first time the MAAA refused anything to the hockey club ) . Inexplicably , the hockey club reversed its position , and the next few months saw a gradual schism between the MAAA and the club . Indeed , the inscriptions on the Cup when it was successfully defended in 1894 only stated "" Montreal HC "" . The MAAA , at one point , considered the hockey club to have seceded from the organization that bore them . The issue would be finally resolved in later years , after various attempts at reconciliation . † Stanley Cup winner According to Arthur Farrell 's book of 1899 , "" Hockey : Canada 's Royal Winter Game "" , Montreal Crystals are recorded as champions in 1887 , and the Montreal Hockey Club is recorded as the winner from 1888-1894 . See reference copy on Backcheck . According to Ultimate Hockey , the play between 1887 and 1892 occurred in the challenge format and the title of champion could change after every series .

22,"Angela Carder ( née Stone ) was an American cancer patient who , in 1987 , was forced to undergo a life-threatening Caesarean section in an unsuccessful attempt to save the life of her fetus . The case stands as a landmark in United States case law establishing the rights of pregnant women to determine their own health care . At age thirteen , Angela Stoner was diagnosed with a rare and usually fatal form of cancer . She survived , and after years of chemotherapy and radiation therapy was declared to be in remission . Ten years after the initial diagnosis she developed another form of cancer , which she and her doctors fought with equal determination . The second cancer went into remission . Angela later married and became pregnant . In 1987 , when Carder was twenty-five weeks pregnant , her cancer was discovered to have recurred and metastasized to her lung . Exactly what plan she made on learning this is unclear : one source claims that she was determined to prolong her life , and elected to start radiation and chemotherapy , regardless of known risks to the fetus ; others state that she chose to institute only palliative care , in an effort to remain alive until the 28th week of gestation , when it was thought the fetus would have a better chance of survival . Whatever her choice , the administrators of George Washington University Hospital -- who were also the liability risk managers -- were disturbed to hear that she had not elected to have an immediate C-section procedure . Fearing a lawsuit by pro-life activists , they convened a court hearing at the hospital and obtained separate counsels for Carder , her fetus , and the hospital . At the hearing , family members , including Carder 's husband , opposed the C-section on the grounds that she would be unlikely to survive it and that she would not want it ( Carder herself , now gravely ill , did not testify ) . Her treating physicians also opposed the procedure . However , a neonatologist not personally familiar with her medical status testified that the fetus would have at least a 60% chance of survival -- nearly that of a healthy woman 's fetus at the same gestational age . Carder 's own long-term oncologist was not contacted ; he has since stated that he would have called the procedure "" medically inadvisable both for Angela Carder and for the fetus "" . Nonetheless , and despite medical testimony that such a procedure would probably end Carder 's life , an order was issued authorizing the hospital to perform an immediate C-section . Obstetricians at the hospital initially refused to carry out the procedure , but eventually one reluctantly agreed . A three-judge appellate panel upheld the decision in an emergency telephone appeal , despite Carder 's own repeated pleas of "" I do n't want it done . "" Exactly how long the fetus survived is a matter of some dispute . The most commonly cited figure is two hours . Susan Faludi quotes the obstetrician who performed the surgery as saying attempts to inflate the fetus 's lungs were "" like trying to ventilate a rock "" . Angela Carder survived her surgery by two days . In the wake of the surgery , Carder 's family and the American Civil Liberties Union 's Reproductive Freedom Project asked the D.C. Court of Appeals to vacate the order and its legal precedent , on grounds that the order had violated Carder 's right to informed consent and her constitutional rights of privacy and bodily integrity . One hundred twenty organizations filed amicus briefs on Carder 's behalf , including the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . One attorney for the hospital argued that it was appropriate to sacrifice a dying woman for her fetus ; an appeals court judge is reported to have replied , "" Are you urging this court to find that you can handcuff a woman to a bed and force her to give birth ? "" On April 26 , 1990 , the court issued the ruling In re A.C. , which vacated the previous decisions and ruled that Angela Carder had the right to make health-care decisions for herself and her fetus . At the same time as the Court of Appeals case , the ACLU and Carder 's parents , Daniel and Nettie Stoner , instituted a civil action , Stoners v. George Washington University Hospital , et al. , suing the hospital for deprivation of human rights , discrimination , wrongful death and malpractice , among other charges . In November of 1990 , days before the scheduled trial was to begin , the hospital settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money and a promise of new hospital policies protecting the rights of pregnant women .",I-PER I-PER O O I-PER O O O I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O I-ORG O I-PER O O O I-PER O I-PER I-PER O O O O O O I-PER O I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,S,E,E,,,,,
